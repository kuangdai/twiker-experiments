Jia Mu, however, remained momentarily confused. Fengjie added a few more words, and Jia Mu finally smiled wryly, “It may work, but it will make poor Miss Bao suffer. If the ruckus breaks out, what then of Lin Guniang?” Fengjie answered, “This matter is to be told only to Baoyu—no one else shall hear a word.” At that moment a maid announced, “Second Master Lian has returned.” Madam Wang, fearing that Jia Mu might question him, exchanged a knowing glance with Fengjie. Fengjie went out to meet Jia Lian, pursing her lips as she joined Madam Wang in waiting. After a while, Madam Wang re-entered, her eyes red from weeping. Jia Lian offered his respects and then explained the situation at Shili Tun regarding the preparations for Prince Wang Teng’s funeral. He added, “I have received an imperial edict appointing our uncle to the Cabinet, with the title of Wenqin Duke; he has ordered that our family shall carry his casket back home, with palace officials escorting him along the way. Yesterday he departed, and the rest of the family has already returned south. Our maternal aunt sent word to inquire after us, saying ‘Who would have thought you could not enter the capital? There is so much unsaid—if my elder brother happens to meet you on the road, let him come and explain in detail.’” Hearing this, Madam Wang’s grief deepened. Fengjie consoled her, “Madam, please rest for a while; let us discuss Baoyu’s matter tonight.” After that, Fengjie returned with Jia Lian to her own room and discreetly told him to set aside any talk of the new bridal chamber. Later that day, after breakfast, Daiyu, accompanied by Zizhuan, went to see Jia Mu—both to pay her respects and to lift her spirits. As she left the Xiang Pavilion, she walked a few steps but suddenly recalled that she had forgotten her handkerchief. She sent Zizhuan back to fetch it while she ambled slowly, waiting. Just then, near Qinfang Bridge—by the very stone where Baoyu once lay flowers for the dead—she heard someone weeping softly. Daiyu paused and strained her ears but could not make out whose cry it was or what sorrowful words were being uttered. Curious, she approached slowly. There, she saw a maid with thick brows and large eyes weeping. At first, Daiyu suspected that one of the senior maids in the household might be venting her woes; but on closer look, she could not recognize the girl. The maid, noticing Daiyu’s approach, ceased her crying and wiped away her tears. Daiyu asked, “Why are you so heartbroken?” The maid, still crying, said, “Miss Lin, please judge the matter. When they speak, I don’t know what to say—I just uttered one wrong word, and my elder sister beat me!” Daiyu, not quite understanding, asked, “Who is your elder sister?” The maid replied, “It’s Sister Zhenzhu.” Only then did Daiyu realize that the maid belonged to Jia Mu’s household. She inquired further, “And what is your name?” The maid answered, “I’m called ‘Silly Big Sister.’” Daiyu smiled gently and asked, “And why did your sister beat you? What did you say?” The maid replied, “It was about Second Master Baoyu marrying Miss Bao.” At the sound of this, Daiyu was struck like a bolt of lightning; her heart pounded wildly. Gathering herself, she beckoned, “Come with me.” The maid followed Daiyu to the secluded spot by the peach-blossom tomb. There, behind a quiet outcrop, Daiyu asked, “Why did they beat you over Baoyu marrying Miss Bao?” “Silly Big Sister” explained, “Our old lady, Madam Wang, and Second Mistress discussed it. Since our old master is to leave soon, they decided to hurry off to negotiate with the second mistress to bring Miss Bao into the family. First, they intended it as a ‘good luck’ match for Second Master; then… ” At this point she smiled at Daiyu before continuing, “They even mentioned to Miss Lin about the bride’s family.” Daiyu was left dumbfounded.
I suggest we first use a remedy called ‘Hei Xiaoyao’ to disperse stagnation, followed by one called ‘Gui Fei Gu Jin’ to consolidate your lung’s metal. I do not claim to be perfect; I await your high counsel.”  After writing out a prescription along with a list of seven medicinal ingredients and an herbal adjuvant, Jia Lian reviewed it and inquired, “Does the formula account for blood stagnation? Is Bupleurum appropriate?”  The doctor laughed and explained, “Second Master, you only know Bupleurum as an uplifting herb for expelling excess—yet few know that when stir-fried with soft turtle blood, it prevents excessive rising while nourishing the liver yin and quelling pernicious fire. As the Neijing says, ‘When the channel is open, use open herbs; when it is blocked, use blocking herbs.’ This method is exactly what we are employing.”  Jia Lian nodded. “Very well, then. Have him take two doses for now and adjust later if needed. I trust he will recover soon.”  The doctor then departed with Jia Lian, who saw to it that the medicine was promptly administered. Meanwhile, Jia Lian returned to his room and reported to Madame Feng and Dai-yu about the treatment. Not long after, Zhou Ruiguai (Zhou Rui’s voice) arrived with some minor news. Jia Lian, hearing this, said, “You go back to Second Madame; I have matters to attend to,” and then departed. Later, Zhou Ruiguai mentioned that when he visited Lin-girl, her condition was dire: she had no color in her face and her body felt as if reduced to mere bones; she shed tears without uttering a word. He returned with Ziyuan saying, “The young miss is so ill that she barely asks for help. I plan to request an extra allowance from Second Madame’s monthly stipend so she can have a little money for medicine. After all, even the little expenses amount to a few coins.” He assured them he would convey this to the elders. Madame Feng shook her head and said, “Give her a few taels of silver if you must—but don’t mention it to Lin-girl. Monthly expenses are hard to cover anyway. If everyone’s money were spent, how could we manage? Don’t you recall how Zhao Yiniang and Third Sister quarreled? It was all over money. Besides, lately, more is spent on those who go out than comes in—what can one do? Some even say I plan to move our funds to my natal home. Zhou, since you handle these matters, you surely know something.” Zhou Ruiguai grumbled, “It’s truly vexing! With such a grand household, only a matriarch like our Grandmother could manage it. Even a man with several arms wouldn’t be able to handle it. And don’t get me started on those scandalous words!”  He continued, “Some people say: ‘The silver repository in the Jia mansion is filled with gold-inlaid, jade-encrusted items; the wealth is so vast that even the palace’s furnishings pale in comparison. When the imperial consort visits, she brings back several carts of gold and silver, and our household is decorated like a crystal palace. On the day of the temple vow, we spent tens of thousands of silver coins—practically, it’s as if we plucked a single hair from an ox. Others say that even the stone lions in front of our mansion are made of jade, and our garden has a golden qilin; if one is caught stealing one, you’d think it’s worth nothing. Even our maidservants, who serve without question, have their own roles. When it comes to drinking and playing chess, even the most mundane details are arranged meticulously. People claim that if one could bring down the moon from the sky, they would, just to amuse themselves.’”  At this point, Zhou Ruiguai suddenly stopped mid-sentence, realizing he’d said something improper, and swallowed his words. Madame Feng, having understood that his remark was not to her liking, said, “Where did the reference to ‘golden qilin’ come from?” Zhou Ruiguai laughed and explained, “It comes from that old Taoist in the temple who once gave Second Master a little golden qilin.
Over time, this became habitual, and it even led Jin Gui to increasingly insult Baochan. Baochan, who could not compare with Xiangling, was like dry tinder; having bonded with Xue Pan over shared feelings, he completely disregarded Jin Gui. Outraged by Jin Gui’s continual mistreatment, Baochan refused to back down. At first there were quarrels and shoving; later Jin Gui’s anger escalated to insults, and then even to physical blows. Though Baochan dared not fight back, he began to roll and flail about as if seeking death, both by day with knives and scissors, and by night with ropes – causing endless havoc. Xue Pan, caught between conflicting loyalties, stood helplessly by, thoroughly exasperated, and eventually left the house in despair. Jin Gui, meanwhile, secretly explained to Baochan that that very night Xue Pan was to “marry” in Qiu Ling’s room – that is, she was to be made to accompany Jin Gui in bed. At first Qiu Ling refused, but Jin Gui insisted, claiming that she was being too fastidious and that comfort was secondary to convenience in the dark of night. She scolded, “Have you not seen our master? He takes every opportunity to hoard his maidservants and won’t let you near – what is your plan? I fear you intend to drive me to ruin!” Xue Pan, fearing that this might ruin Baochan’s reputation, quickly returned and admonished Qiu Ling, “If you do not obey, I will beat you!” Qiu Ling, with no choice, had to gather her bedding and lie down on the floor, reluctantly obeying. No sooner had she laid down than she was summoned repeatedly for tea throughout the night, and her legs were pounded several times so that she could not rest for a moment. Xue Pan, having secured Baochan as if it were a treasure, ignored all else. In his bitterness, Jin Gui murmured, “Let him have his fun for a few days; once he grows distant, then I can arrange for Xiangling. Then Baochan, originally mine, will be useless.” Quietly enduring, she schemed to further manipulate Qiu Ling. After about half a month, Qiu Ling suddenly pretended to be ill, complaining of unbearable heartache and immobility with treatments proving ineffective. Everyone remarked that it was due to her suppressed anger. After two days, unexpectedly, someone discovered a paper effigy hidden among Jin Gui’s pillows – bearing her age and an inscription of eight characters, with five needles pinned into her heart area and the gaps between her ribs and limbs. Thus the household took this as news and reported it first to Aunt Xue. Aunt Xue, now frantic, and Xue Pan, even more disordered, threatened to interrogate everyone. Jin Gui said, “There is no need to wrong innocent people. It appears that Baochan’s ‘demon-repelling charm’ must be used.” Xue Pan replied, “But she has not spent much time in your room lately; why cling to a good woman?” Jin Gui sneered, “Who else is there? Am I not the only one? Even if there were others, who would dare enter my room?” Xue Pan said, “Now that Qiu Ling follows you every day, she surely knows; question her and you will find out.” Jin Gui laughed coldly, “Question whom? Who will confess? In my view, they will all feign ignorance—so let it drop. Besides, even if I were to be punished to death, it matters little; I could always remarry someone better. Truly, if you complain, who will not blame me?” Bursting into tears, she continued, “Then why must you drag everyone into this? I fear I will be blamed if you persist.” Xue Pan’s anger mounted, and he snatched up a door bolt, stormed off, and without further ado confronted Qiu Ling, accusing her directly. Qiu Ling cried out in protest. Aunt Xue rushed in and commanded, “Do not start beating before you understand the whole story! This maidservant has served for years—was it not that she was careless once? Would you really do something so heartless? Ask clearly first, then act!” Hearing his mother’s words, Jin Gui feared Xue Pan might soften, and she began to cry bitterly, “For half a month you have monopolized my Baochan, kept her from entering my room, and only allowed Qiu Ling to sleep with me.
At this moment, Madame herself is coming out to inspect the garden.” They then ordered, “Quickly call the people from Yihong Courtyard to meet her at the door and escort her out.” Amused, they added, “Ah, Amitabha! Today, once the heavens open their eyes and send this troublesome imp away, everyone will be at peace.” Bao Yu, upon hearing that Madame Wang was coming for a thorough search, was sure that even Qingwen would not be spared, and hastily fled—but later, as he mumbled his resentful words, he heard nothing further. Later that night at dawn, a little maid from Madame Wang’s room opened the front corner door and announced Madame Wang’s orders: “Immediately rouse Bao Yu; wash your face and change your clothes. Today someone has invited the master to admire the autumn chrysanthemums. Since the master liked the poem you composed the other day, he wishes to take them with him. Huan’er has already arrived. Hurry up and go—I am off to call Lan’er now.” The old women inside responded in turn, fastening their buttons as they opened the door. Yingren, upon hearing the call, realized something was afoot and immediately sent for water to wash his face, urging Bao Yu to get up and groom himself. Bao Yu, recalling that he was due to go out with Jia Zheng, did not dare present his best new clothes but chose a third-rate outfit instead. In his dismay, Bao Yu hurriedly went out, and sure enough, Jia Zheng was already there enjoying tea, delighted. Bao Yu greeted him with early salutations; Jia Huan and Jia Lan also met him. Jia Zheng then said, “Although Bao Yu may be lacking in his studies compared to you two, when it comes to composing and matching verses, none compare to him. Today, as we leave, you must each compose a poem; Bao Yu, you must assist the others.” Madame Wang, who had never heard such remarks, was unexpectedly delighted. After a while, his father and sons left; then, as Jia Zheng was about to go to Grandmother Jia’s side, Jia Huan’s wet-nurse and a few other senior maidservants arrived, reporting that Fangguan had been honored by Madame’s grace and had been driven into a frenzy—refusing to eat and determined to seduce Ou Guan and Rui Guan; the three of them were so desperate that they even contemplated becoming nuns. I thought they were merely children unaccustomed to going out, but now they are so unruly that I fear for them. Truly, I have no remedy; therefore, I beg madame either to let them become nuns or to discipline them and assign proper wives instead. This news was delivered in hushed tones as if it were a grave matter. Madame Wang said, “Nonsense! How can these girls so easily enter the Buddhist order? Anyone who wishes to do so must follow the proper rites. I, being kind-hearted, have vowed that all are equal in the Buddha’s eyes. Now, since a few girls, fatherless and far from home, have known both wealth and hardship from an early age, and now wish to escape their miseries by entering the order, then perhaps ‘turning back from the bitter sea’ and embracing the monastic life might indeed be their wish. But do not let me hinder such benevolence.” Being a kind soul herself, Madame Wang at first listened as if it were merely the ramblings of children; but with recent household troubles and news from Mrs. Xing that Yingchun’s family would soon be invited to stay for two days so that they might be seen, and with official channels already in motion, her heart grew heavy with matters beyond such trifles. Thus, she laughed and said, “Then you two shall take them as your apprentices.” Her two maternal aunts, hearing this, bowed deeply and exclaimed, “Excellent, excellent! In that case, our late madame’s merits are considerable indeed.” Madame Wang then said, “Inquire of him. If he is sincere, then come up here and formally become a disciple in my presence.” The three girls who had gone out eventually returned with the three young apprentices. Madame Wang questioned them repeatedly; once they made up their minds, they kowtowed with the two aunts and then excused themselves. Seeing that their minds were determined and that she could no longer force the matter, Madame Wang’s anger softened into pity.
Not a sound of endless chess moves is heard in the day,   While sticky clay dots stain the game board. Ancient men lament parting and cherish their friends;   How much more do I now feel the bond of kinship! Barely finishing his verse, Bao Yu suddenly heard someone behind him laughing, “What are you spacing out for again?” Bao Yu turned around quickly to see who it was; it turned out to be Xiangling. Bao Yu quickly turned and asked with a smile, “Sister, what brings you here at this hour? It has been many days since you last came in to wander about.” Xiangling clapped her hands merrily and said, “I have never been reluctant to come. Now that your brother has returned, he is freer than before. Just earlier, our madame sent someone to call on Feng, but they could not find her—so they said she had come to the garden. Hearing this, I was assigned to go look for her. I encountered her maid who said she was in Daoxiang Village. Now, as I head to Daoxiang Village, I happened to meet you again. I also wish to ask: Has sister Xi Ren been well these past days? And why is it that sister Qingwen is nowhere to be seen? The second daughter left so quickly—look, the place is suddenly so empty.” Bao Yu could only agree and then asked her to join him for tea in the Yihong Courtyard. Xiangling said, “I cannot go at the moment; I must first see Second Aunt, and after we discuss proper matters I will come.” Bao Yu asked, “What proper matters? Why such haste?” Xiangling replied, “It is about your brother’s marriage. That is most important.” Bao Yu said, “Which family is considered favorable? I have only heard half a year’s worth of noise—yesterday someone spoke highly of the Zhang family, tomorrow they will praise the Li family, and the day after, they will discuss how fine the Wang family is. Yet these young ladies, it seems, have incurred some sin that has led others to criticize them.” Xiangling said, “Once it is settled, there is no need to involve others.” Bao Yu asked, “Settled with which family?” Xiangling replied, “Because when your brother went out the other day, he happened to visit a relative’s house. This relative, being an old kin and also a well-known merchant in the Ministry of Revenue, was known in the capital—from the highest nobles to the common traders, all referring to his family as the ‘Guihua Xia Family.’” Bao Yu laughed, “How can they also be called the ‘Guihua Xia Family’?” Xiangling explained, “Their surname is Xia—they are extremely wealthy. They own dozens of hectares planted with osmanthus; in Chang’an, both inside and outside the city, every osmanthus bureau belongs to them, and even the potted displays in the palace come from their offerings. That is why their family is so well known. Now that your father is gone, only the old matriarch remains with a daughter of her own—but alas, all her sons have perished. It is a pity they have lost all descendants.” Bao Yu hastily said, “Let’s not worry about whether they will have heirs—what matters is, is that daughter favorable? Why did your elder brother favor her?” Xiangling smiled, “For one, fate has its way; and also, ‘beauty is in the eye of the beholder.’ In days past we were very close as cousins, playing together from childhood. Though we have been apart these past few years, the moment she sees your brother again, our old matriarch, who has no sons, will cry and smile—more so than if she saw her own son. Then the siblings meet again. Who would have thought that this daughter, blossoming like a flower, is now well-educated and writes beautifully, and your brother was utterly smitten from the start. Even the pawnbrokers, harassed for three or four days, eventually had to release her. The moment your brother returned home, he begged madame repeatedly to seek her hand. Our madame had met her before and, given that their statuses matched, agreed. After discussing with the other secondary wives and Miss Feng, arrangements were made. It was just that the wedding happened so hastily that everything became chaotic. I too wished she would come earlier, and thereby added another poet to our midst.” Bao Yu sneered, “Even if so, I worry for you.” Xiangling asked, “What do you mean?” Bao Yu laughed, “What do you not understand?
Soon, Xueyan, having finished her meal, returned to attend to Daiyu. Daiyu asked, “It’s getting cold. Didn’t I ask you the other day to hang out that little fur garment? Was it done?” Xueyan replied, “Yes, all has been hung out.” Daiyu said, “Bring one for me to put on.” Xueyan went and returned with a bundle of small fur clothes. As she opened the felt package so that Daiyu might select one, she noticed a silk packet tucked inside. Daiyu reached in, opened it, and discovered it was an old handkerchief sent by Baoyu when he was ill—its poem still bearing traces of tears. Inside the packet were also the clipped remains of a sachet, a fan bag, and the tassel from Baoyu’s Tongling Jade. It turned out that when the clothes were being sorted, someone had found these items in a chest; fearful they might be lost, Zijuan had slipped them into the felt package. Daiyu, who might otherwise have ignored the garment, now took the two handkerchiefs in her hand and gazed vacantly at the old poem. After a long while, tears began to fall in a soft, pattering cascade. Just then, Zijuan returned from the outer room. She saw Xueyan holding the felt bundle of clothes, with the torn sachet, a few pieces of the fan bag, and the disassembled tassel laid out on the small table. In Daiyu’s hand were the two old handkerchiefs inscribed with faded characters, and she was quietly weeping as she stared at them. Zijuan, realizing that Daiyu was deeply moved by these relics of the past, knew that no amount of words of consolation could ease her sorrow. Smiling gently, she said, “Miss, why do you still linger over these things? They are merely the trifling jokes that arose between Baoyu and you in your youth—happy moments interspersed with quarrels. With the way things are now, if you continue to cling to them, they will never be of any use.” At first, Zijuan’s words seemed to console Daiyu; but unexpectedly, they stirred up old memories of her early days with Baoyu, and soon her tears flowed unceasingly. Zijuan tried again to comfort her, “Xueyan is waiting, Miss—please put on a garment.” Then, Daiyu reluctantly set aside the handkerchiefs. Zijuan quickly gathered up the sachet and other items and removed them from view. Daiyu then put on a leather jacket and, feeling deeply dejected, went to sit in the outer room. Glancing back at the table, she saw Baochai’s poem still lying there. She took it out to read it once more, and sighed, “Fate differs, and sorrow remains as one; I must compose four more verses—set to a zither tune, so that it may be played and sung. Tomorrow I shall write them out and send them to Baochai as a companion piece.” She then called Xueyan to fetch her brushes and inkstone from the table outside. Dipping her brush in ink, she composed four folded pages of verse. Next, she retrieved her zither score, borrowed two pieces—“Ode to the Fragrant Orchid” and “Lament for the Worthy”—and harmonized them with a melody of her own making, writing them down as a gift to Baochai. Soon after, she asked Xueyan to bring out the small qin (zither) she had carried in her trunk. Tuning its strings, she began to demonstrate her finger techniques. Though her fingers were a bit unpracticed from disuse, Daiyu was naturally brilliant—having studied in the south for some time—and soon the techniques became familiar. After a while, noticing that it was already late at night, she told Zijuan to tidy up and prepare for bed, and nothing further was mentioned. Meanwhile, that day Baoyu rose, washed, and, carrying his tea for the afternoon, headed toward the study. Suddenly, Mo Yu ran up laughing and cheerfully announced, “Second Master, today you’re in luck! The master isn’t in the study—classes have been dismissed!” Baoyu asked, “Really?” Mo Yu replied, “If you don’t believe me, haven’t you seen that Third Master and Lan Ge have arrived?” Looking up, Baoyu saw Jia Huan and Jia Lan arriving with a few junior servants.
There she saw two little boys, dressed in powder and fine brocade, serving drinks. Today, Xue Pan had just lost his bet and was in a foul mood; fortunately, his fortunes soon turned, and aside from settling the account, he ended up winning quite a bit, which lifted his spirits considerably. Jia Zhen then said, “Let us pause—let’s have something to eat first.” He then asked, “How are the two sections doing?” At that moment, while the games of “Tian Jiu” and “Driving Old Goats” were still underway, a table was set for the latter game, and Jia Zhen joined in the meal. Buoyed by his good mood, Xue Pan embraced one of the young boys to drink, and then ordered his wine to be dedicated to “the silly uncle.” The silly uncle, having little sympathy for the losers, downed two bowls and became slightly drunk. Irritated that the serving boys only attended to the winners and ignored the losers, he scolded, “You bunch of rabbits—you heartless little brats! Every day you all get a share of someone’s favor. And just because you lost a few taels of silver this time, you are now divided into ranks. Could it be that from now on you’ll never come to ask for my help?” Seeing him with his wine, the losers dared not speak but merely smiled subtly. The winners quickly remarked, “Uncle, you scold so fittingly. All you little runtish fellows are of this custom.” They then joked, “And why don’t you pour Uncle some wine?” The two little children, who had been playing their part all along, immediately knelt down to serve wine, clinging to the silly uncle’s legs and playfully saying, “Please, sir, do not be angry. Our teacher says that no matter how near or far, one must show favor to whoever has money. If you do not believe it, wait until you win the next big bet and then see what we mean.” Their words made everyone laugh. Unable to contain his laughter, the silly uncle reached out to grab some wine and said, “Had I not seen you two so pitiful as always, I would have kicked your little dumplings out with one swift kick.” As he lifted his leg, the two children seized the moment, rising even more coquettishly, holding onto a piece of floral silk to support his hand, and then dumping an entire jug of wine into his mouth. The silly uncle laughed heartily, then, after playfully twisting the child’s face, remarked, “Now that I see it, I feel almost tender-hearted.” Suddenly recalling an old incident, he pounded the table and said to Jia Zhen, “Yesterday, when your maternal aunt and I quarreled, did you know?” Jia Zhen replied, “I did not hear a word.” The silly uncle sighed, “It was all because of money! Dear nephew, you have no idea about the inner workings of our Xing family. When our old lady passed away, I was but a child and knew nothing of the world. Among the three sisters, only your maternal aunt was considered the eldest. When she married, she took all the family property with her. Now that your second aunt has also married out, her household is in dire straits; while your third aunt still remains at home, with all household expenses managed by the Wang Shambao family. I only came to ask for a few taels of silver—not to claim the family property. Even my own Xing family’s assets would suffice for my needs. But alas, I could not obtain any, so you all end up saying I’m broke!” Seeing him inebriated, Jia Zhen quickly interposed with soothing words. Outside, Lady You and the others, having heard everything clearly, whispered to Silver Butterfly and the others, “Listen—that is the complaint of the mistress of the North Courtyard’s brother. Clearly even his own brothers are like this, so it’s no wonder these people behave so shamelessly.” While they were still listening, the players of the “Driving Old Goats” game also paused for a drink. One person then asked, “Who is it that offended Uncle? We didn’t quite catch it—please tell us so we can judge fairly.” Xing Dequan then repeated, ignoring the comments of the two serving children. One of the onlookers replied, “It’s infuriating—there’s no way Uncle wouldn’t be angry.
Let me tell you: Yesterday I beat the wife of Wang Shanbao; I even bore the full brunt of punishment. It was nothing more than speaking some idle chatter behind closed doors—do you think they’d also beat me up?” Miss Bao quickly asked, “And why did you beat her?” Miss Tan Chun then recounted last night’s events in full detail. Upon hearing this, Lady You, seeing that Miss Tan Chun had revealed everything, went on to recount what had happened with Miss Xi Chun earlier. Miss Tan Chun said, “That is just her temper – so hot-headed that we cannot fight back against her.” She then added, “This morning, when nothing was amiss, I had people inquire about Miss Feng’s condition, and they went around to ask about the situation at Wang Shanbao’s household. They later reported back to me, saying, ‘The household of Wang Shanbao received a good beating, and he is indignant at their meddling.’” Both Lady You and Miss Li agreed, “That is just right.” Miss Tan Chun coldly laughed, “This kind of matter—so as to hide the truth—is something anyone can do. Let’s wait and see.” Both Lady You and Miss Li were left speechless. After a while, the maidservants called for dinner. Xiang Yun and Miss Bao then went back to their rooms to change their clothes, and the details need not be repeated. Lady You bade farewell to Miss Li and headed toward Grandmother Jia’s side. Grandmother Jia reclined on her couch while Madame Wang was discussing how the Zhen family had been punished, with all their property confiscated and sent to the capital for trial. Grandmother Jia, upon hearing this, felt deeply uneasy. Just then she noticed her sister arriving and asked, “Where have you come from? And have you heard whether Miss Feng and her two sisters-in-law are ill today?” Lady You and the others quickly replied, “They are feeling somewhat better today.” Grandmother Jia nodded and sighed, “Let’s not concern ourselves with their affairs. Instead, let us plan our proper Mid-Autumn Moon Appreciation on the fifteenth day of August.” Madame Wang laughed, “The arrangements have already been made. I wonder, though, which place will Grandmother choose? I’m only worried that the garden might be too chilly at night.” Grandmother Jia laughed, “What harm is there in wearing a couple more layers? That is the very place for moon-gazing – it cannot be that we shall not go there.”  In the midst of this conversation, the maidservants brought over the dining table, and Madame Wang, Lady You, and the others hurried to set down their utensils and serve the food. Grandmother Jia, seeing that several plates of assorted dishes had been laid out and that two large baskets of various delicacies were also present – in accordance with the old custom for each household’s filial tribute – said, “I have repeatedly instructed you; let it be waived, for you never listen.” Madame Wang laughed, “They are but everyday things. Today I eat vegetarianly; I have no other filial offerings. Those wheat gluten and tofu dishes, Grandmother does not much care for – she only selected one with pepper-oil, watercress, and minced shrimp paste.” Grandmother Jia laughed, “I, too, fancy that dish.” Yuan Yang, upon hearing this, moved her small plate closer. Miss Bao Qin courteously yielded one by one, until everyone was seated. Grandmother Jia then ordered Miss Tan Chun to join her at the table. Miss Tan Chun declined courteously and sat down opposite Miss Bao Qin; a serving clerk hurried off to fetch the bowls and utensils. Yuan Yang then pointed to the several dishes, saying, “These two dishes appear nondescript – they are what the eldest son’s household has prepared as a filial tribute. This bowl of chicken marrow bamboo shoots was sent by the elder master from outside.” As she spoke, she promptly carried that bowl of bamboo shoots to the table. After tasting a few bites, Grandmother Jia commanded, “Send all those dishes back, and just say that I have eaten them. There is no need for them to be delivered every day. I shall request whatever I desire in the future.” The wives and maidservants agreed and sent them off without further ado. Grandmother Jia then said, “Bring some rice porridge for me to eat.” Lady You immediately brought a bowl, saying it was made of red rice.
I want something original, reflecting the sentiments of these past years.” Bao Yu, hearing this, felt it deeply in his heart and immediately composed four lines on paper, which he then presented to Jia Zheng. Jia Zheng read them and nodded silently. Seeing this, Grandmother Jia, satisfied that nothing was amiss, asked, “How is it?” Jia Zheng, eager to please Grandmother Jia, said, “It is troublesome for him. He refuses to read, and in the end his words lack refinement.” Grandmother Jia said, “That’s fine. He should be rewarded so that he will work even harder in the future.” Jia Zheng agreed, “Exactly.” Then he turned and ordered an old nursemaid to go out, “Tell the footmen to fetch the fans I brought from Hainan—two for Bao Yu.” Bao Yu bowed deeply, then returned to his seat to resume the game. At that moment, Jia Lan, seeing that Bao Yu had been rewarded, also took his turn to compose a poem and present it to Jia Zheng. Jia Zheng read it and was even more delighted, then shared it with Grandmother Jia, who was very pleased, and promptly ordered Jia Zheng to bestow rewards upon him. After this, everyone resumed their seats and the game continued. This time, Jia She remained silent, drinking and telling jokes. He said, “In a family, the most filial son is the one whose mother falls ill. When all attempts at finding a doctor fail, one may invite a certain acupuncture woman. This woman, who knew nothing of the pulse, merely claimed it was due to an overactive heart-fire and that one needle would cure it. The son, in panic, asked, ‘If the heart is as hard as iron, how can a needle cure it?’ The woman replied, ‘There is no need to needle the heart—just needle the rib cartilage.’ The son said, ‘But the rib cartilage is far from the heart—how would that work?’ The woman replied, ‘It matters not. You see, among all parents in the world, many are partial to one child!’” Everyone laughed upon hearing this, and even Grandmother Jia could only sip half a cup of wine before laughing and saying, “I, too, need that woman’s acupuncture.” Hearing this, Jia She, knowing he had spoken too roughly, quickly rose, toasted Grandmother Jia with his cup, and offered a brief explanation. Grandmother Jia did not wish to dwell on the subject and resumed the game. Unexpectedly, the turn fell to Jia Huan. Lately, Jia Huan had made some progress in his studies and taken an interest in worldly affairs. Now, upon seeing Bao Yu compose a poem and be rewarded, he felt a creative itch and, though reluctant to act rashly in front of Jia Zheng, he managed to seize a pen and paper, composing a couplet on the spot and presenting it to Jia Zheng. Jia Zheng read it and was intrigued, noticing that its verses carried a trace of disdain for studying, and so he remarked disapprovingly, “It shows that you two siblings—your words and sentiments belong to a degenerate school. In ancient times there were ‘two difficulties’; you two might be called ‘the two difficulties.’ But not the character for ‘difficulty’ per se, rather ‘difficult to instruct’ would be more appropriate. Brother, you openly compare yourself to Wen Feiqing, yet now you and your brother behave as though you are reincarnated as Cao Tang!” This remark made everyone laugh. Jia She said, “Let me see the poem.” He then praised it repeatedly, saying, “In my view, this poem has true backbone. For families like ours, one need not study under dim candlelight; merely reading a few books to grasp some understanding is enough to secure an official post. Why waste so much effort and turn out to be a mere bookworm? That is why I admire this poem—it still carries the spirit of our noble household.” Then he ordered that many of his prized playthings be brought out as rewards for him, patting Jia Huan’s head and laughing, “From now on, continue this way, and your hereditary prospects are assured.” Hearing this, Jia Zheng quickly cautioned, “But he is merely rambling—how does that relate to future matters?” With that, he poured another cup of wine and resumed the game.
No one could find it, yet no one dared to return and report either. In the Yihong Courtyard, everyone looked as though they were made of wood or clay. Just as everyone was lost in thought, word came that those who might know of its whereabouts had arrived. Tan Chun ordered the garden gates closed, and first sent an old maid with two maids out to search every corner; then she gathered everyone and announced, “Whoever finds it will be richly rewarded.”  Eager to dissociate themselves from any blame and upon hearing the heavy reward, everyone threw caution to the wind and searched everywhere—even in the outhouses. Yet, no one could locate it. The jade turned out to be as small as an embroidery needle, and after a full day’s search, there was still no sign of it. Li Wan grew anxious and said, “This matter is no laughing matter. I’m about to say something unseemly.”  Everyone asked, “What is it?”  Li Wan said, “At this point, we must get to the bottom of it. Now that everyone in the garden, apart from Baoyu, is a woman, I ask that each sister, younger sister, and maiden have the accompanying maids undress so that we may search thoroughly. If not, then have the maids search the old maids and the lower-ranked servants. Will that suffice?”  Everyone agreed, “That makes sense. With so many people and hands involved, things can get messy—this way, they can all be cleared of suspicion.” Tan Chun alone remained silent. The maids themselves were willing to expose themselves. First, Ping’er volunteered, “Let me be the first to search.” Thus, everyone disrobed. Li Wan, in a burst of anger, joined in the search. Tan Chun reproached Li Wan, “Sister-in-law, you’re acting just like someone who can’t contribute a line! If someone had stolen it, would they dare hide it on their person? Moreover, this thing is a treasure at home, but outside it would be worthless—why would anyone steal it? I suspect there must be someone inciting mischief.”  Hearing this, everyone’s eyes shifted to Huan’er, who had been absent. Yesterday he had been seen running about the mansion; suspicion naturally fell on him, though no one dared speak it outright. Tan Chun added, “The only one capable of inciting mischief is Huan’er. You must send someone quietly to fetch him, coax him into revealing where it is, and then scare him into keeping silent.”  Everyone nodded. Li Zhi then said to Ping’er, “This matter really requires your intervention to clarify things.” Ping’er agreed and hurried off. Not long after, Huan’er arrived. Pretending as though nothing was amiss, everyone had some tea made and placed in an inner room. They deliberately drifted away, intending for Ping’er to coax Huan’er. Ping’er then smiled and said to Huan’er, “Did you not see that your Second Brother’s jade is missing?”  Huan’er’s face flushed purple in alarm. He glared and said, “Someone’s lost something and you’re dragging me into it? Am I to be treated like a common thief?”  Seeing this, Ping’er dared not press further and, still smiling, said, “That’s not what I meant. I was just making sure, lest Third Master uses it to frighten everyone—so I had to ask if you had seen it.”  Huan’er replied, “It’s on him—whether you see it or not should be directed to him. Why ask me? You all seem to be fussing over it, and when something is lost you come to interrogate me!” With that, he got up and left. The others found it hard to restrain him. At this point, Baoyu grew anxious and said, “It’s all this clamor and fuss! I don’t want any more trouble—if Huan’er leaves, word will spread throughout the courtyard. This is not mere mischief!”  Xiren and the others burst into sobs, “Little ancestor, don’t you see? It doesn’t matter if the jade is lost—if the authorities find out, we’ll all be ruined.” Soon, they broke into uncontrollable cries.
I was the one who mentioned it, and now you’re getting all excited.” Without further reply, Baoyu lowered his head and proceeded to the Xiaoxiang Pavilion. There he found Daiyu leaning over a table reading a book. Baoyu approached with a smile and said, “Sister, you’ve returned early?” Daiyu smiled in reply, “And what else would I be doing if you ignored me?” Baoyu laughed, “There were so many people talking that I couldn’t find an opening to speak with you.” He then noticed that the book Daiyu was reading was filled with characters he did not recognize. Some looked like the character for “shao” (peony), others like “mang” (vague), and there was one with the “da” (big) radical combined with a “nine” and a hook with a “wu” in the middle; yet another had on its top a “wu” and “liu” with a “mu” added, and a “wu” below. Puzzled and bemused, he remarked, “Sister, you’ve really advanced in your studies lately—this script looks like an entirely foreign language to me.” Daiyu snorted with laughter, “So you, who claim to be well-read, have never even seen a zither score?” Baoyu said, “You don’t know about zither scores? Why is it that not one of the characters on it seems familiar to you? Can you read them?” Daiyu replied, “No—what’s the point of reading them if you don’t understand their meaning?” Baoyu said, “I don’t believe it. I’ve never heard you claim that you can play the zither. In our study there hang several scores; a few years ago, a refined guest by the name of Ji Haogu came and was invited by our master to play a tune. He took down the zither, only to say that he couldn’t manage it—and added, ‘If the old master is pleased, perhaps another day I might bring my zither and ask for guidance.’ I suppose our master did not understand, so he never returned. How is it that you have acquired such skill in keeping a score hidden?” Daiyu replied, “I’ve never truly mastered it. The other day, feeling a bit better, I was browsing the large bookcase and chanced upon a set of zither scores with great refinement. They explained the principles of the instrument so clearly—the techniques were laid out in detail. It is truly the work of the ancients in cultivating the mind and spirit. When I was in Yangzhou, I heard people speak of such refined matters and even studied a little, but I gave it up and that was that. Truly, ‘if one does not play for three days, one’s fingers become calloused with thorns.’ The scores I saw the other day had only the titles of pieces without the musical notation. I went elsewhere to find a version that included the actual musical passages, which made it all the more interesting. But exactly how to play it well remains an enigma. The texts say that when Shi Kuang played the zither, he could summon wind, thunder, dragons, and phoenixes; even Confucius himself learned the art from Shi Xiang, and a single piece would reveal the essence of King Wen. ‘High Mountains and Flowing Waters’—only by encountering a kindred spirit can one truly appreciate it.” At this, her eyes drooped slightly and she lowered her head. Baoyu, delighted by her explanation, said, “Sister, what you’ve just said is truly fascinating. But I have to confess: I cannot recognize a single character on the score. Will you teach me a few?” Daiyu replied, “There is no need—once explained, it is self-evident.” Baoyu persisted, “I’m a muddle-headed fellow. Please teach me that character which looks like a ‘big’ with a hook and a ‘wu’ in the middle.” Daiyu laughed and said, “That ‘big’ character with the ‘nine’ is actually produced by pressing your left thumb on the ‘nine-mark’ on the zither; the hook with the ‘wu’ is produced by your right hand plucking the ‘five-string’—they are not one character at all but represent a single note, and the method is very simple.
Grandmaster Dai then said, “Today, for the first time, I will send you home early. Tomorrow, I want you to recite a chapter at the family school so that I may assess your progress.” Bao Yu’s heart began to race wildly. (…To be continued in the next installment.) Chapter 83: When Yuanfei in the Palace Falls Ill and the Inner Chambers Are in Tumult as Bao Chai Swallows Her Grievances  When Tan-chun and Xiang-yun were just about to leave, they suddenly heard someone outside shouting, “You little imp, what are you doing messing about in this garden?” At once, Dai-yu cried out, “There’s no place for me to stay here!” and pointed out the window, her eyes brimming with anger. Although Dai-yu lived in the Grand View Garden and was dearly loved by Grandmother Jia, she was always cautious around others. Now, hearing that old maid’s abusive words—and as if they were directed at her personally—her heart broke, and she burst into tears. Ziyuan only cried out, “What’s wrong, dear? Please wake up!” and Tan-chun also called after her. After a while, Dai-yu caught her breath but could not speak; she still pointed angrily out the window. Understanding her distress, Tan-chun went out. Soon she encountered an old maid carrying a cane who was hurrying a scruffy, unkempt serving girl, scolding her, “I’m here to tend to the garden’s flowers and trees—what business do you have here? Go back to your quarters, or I’ll beat you!” The maid, twisting her head and with a finger in her mouth, merely grinned at the old woman. Tan-chun scolded, “You lot have utterly lost all sense of discipline! Is this where you are allowed to hurl insults?” The old maid, upon realizing it was Tan-chun, quickly put on a false smile and explained, “It was my granddaughter who followed me when I came out; I was afraid she would cause a fuss, so I shouted for her to go back. I dare not let her swear here!” Tan-chun replied, “Enough—everyone, go out at once! Lin-girl isn’t feeling well; you must hurry and get her help!” The maid and the serving girl both mumbled their “Yes, ma’am!” and hurried off. Returning inside, Tan-chun found that Xiang-yun was holding Dai-yu’s hand while Dai-yu wept uncontrollably, with Ziyuan cradling her and gently massaging her chest until her eyes gradually cleared. Tan-chun smiled and said, “I guess you’ve grown suspicious from the old maid’s words?” Dai-yu shook her head. Tan-chun continued, “They were only cursing their own granddaughter—and I heard it clearly. These sorts of insults have no reason or propriety; they never observe any taboos. How could a daughter of a wealthy family, orphaned as you are, be treated so contemptuously by someone who must have been sent by someone else? Who would dare to let such abuse happen?” Overwhelmed, Dai-yu burst into further tears. Ziyuan urged, “Tell me—what exactly is troubling you? Please wake up!”  Tan-chun consoled her, “Don’t be upset. I have come for you as your sister should. You’re so isolated now; if you take your medicine and fill your heart with pleasant thoughts, you can slowly regain your strength. We sisters still gather for poetry societies—would that not be delightful?”  Xiang-yun interjected, “But didn’t Third Sister say that you’re in no mood to be cheerful?”  Dai-yu, choking back tears, replied, “How can I be cheerful when I have no strength to face another day? I fear I simply cannot bear it.”  Tan-chun gently said, “Now, rest for a while. When you need anything, just have Ziyuan call for me.”  With that, Dai-yu tearfully told them, “Please, when you go to Grandmother’s place, only tell her I send my respects and that I’m a bit unwell—nothing serious that should worry her.”  Tan-chun promised, “I understand.
Jin Gui said, “There is no need to wrong the innocent; it appears that Baochan’s ‘demon-repelling charm’ must be employed.” Xue Pan replied, “But she has not spent much time in your room lately; why cling to a good woman?” Jin Gui sneered, “Who else is there? Am I not the only one? Even if there were others, who would dare enter my room?” Xue Pan said, “Now that Qiu Ling follows you every day, she surely knows; ask her and you will find out.” Jin Gui laughed coldly, “Ask whom? Who will confess? In my opinion, they will all pretend not to know – so let it drop. Besides, even if I were to be punished to death, it matters little; I could always remarry someone better. Truly, if you complain, who will not blame me?” Tears streaming down, she continued, “Then why must you involve everyone? I fear I will be blamed if you persist.” Xue Pan’s anger mounted further, and he seized a door bolt, stormed off, and without further ado confronted Qiu Ling, accusing her bluntly. Qiu Ling cried out in protest. Aunt Xue rushed in and commanded, “Do not start beating her until you know the whole truth! This maidservant has served for years—was there not a time when she made a mistake? Would you really do something so heartless? Ask clearly first, then act!” Hearing this, Jin Gui feared that Xue Pan might soften and began to weep bitterly, “For half a month you have monopolized my Baochan, kept her from entering my room, and only allowed Qiu Ling to sleep with me. I wish to question Baochan, yet you continue protecting him. Now you act so defiantly as to beat her—if you kill me, then remarry as you please; why must you put on this farce?” Xue Pan’s anger grew even more. Aunt Xue, seeing how her daughter-in-law oppressed her son, cursed bitterly. In her fury she ordered, “Sell Xiangling immediately!” Miss Bao then laughed, “Our family only knows how to buy people, not sell them—madam, you are completely confused. If word gets out, won’t it be a laughingstock? If my elder brother and sister-in-law despise her and leave her to me, I’m doomed!” Aunt Xue replied, “Better to dismiss her entirely than let her remain with us.” Miss Bao laughed, “Whether she stays with me or not is of no consequence—cut her off as if she were sold.” Xiangling had already run up to Aunt Xue, pleading bitterly and crying, unwilling to leave; she wished instead to remain with the young lady. Aunt Xue, with no alternative, had to relent. After that, Xiangling left with Miss Bao, effectively severing her ties with the past. Yet she could not help but feel sorrow under the moonlight, and by lamplight she quietly lamented. Although she had spent several years in Xue Pan’s household, her delicate condition – worsened by her inherited illness – meant she never bore children; now, further aggravated by anger and distress, her health declined, and she eventually developed a “dry blood” disorder, growing thinner and losing her appetite with no remedy proving effective. Meanwhile, Jin Gui continued to quarrel with Xue Pan. On occasion, bolstered by wine, he confronted her twice. When he tried to strike with a stick, Jin Gui dodged and ordered him away. When he nearly drew a knife, she stretched out her neck defiantly. Unable to bring himself to hit her, Xue Pan raged for a while before giving up. Over time, this became habitual, and Jin Gui’s insults toward Baochan grew ever more severe. Baochan, who could not compare with Xiangling, was like dry tinder; having bonded with Xue Pan through shared feelings, he completely disregarded Jin Gui. Outraged by her continual mistreatment, Baochan refused to relent. At first there were verbal spats and shoving; later Jin Gui’s anger escalated to physical blows. Though Baochan dared not fight back, he began to thrash about as if courting death – by day with knives and scissors, by night with ropes – causing endless commotion. Xue Pan, caught between loyalties he could not resolve, eventually stood helplessly by, thoroughly exasperated, and left the house in despair. Jin Gui, meanwhile, secretly explained to Baochan that that very night Xue Pan was to be “married” in Qiu Ling’s room – meaning that she was to be forced to accompany him in bed.
Jia Yun, dejected, had no choice but to leave with Chuo Yao. That evening, when Baoyu returned to his room, Xiren said, “Today, little Yun came by the corridor.” Baoyu asked, “About what?” Xiren replied, “He also brought a note.” Baoyu said, “Where is it? Hand it over so I can see.” Mèiyuè went off to fetch it from some documents in the inner room. Baoyu took it and saw that on the cover it read, “Greetings from Uncle.” Baoyu said, “Why does this child no longer acknowledge me as his father?” Xiren asked, “What do you mean?” Baoyu replied, “The year before last when he sent me a white begonia, he addressed me as ‘Father’; but today the envelope cover says ‘Uncle’—has he now disowned me?” Xiren said, “He’s shameless, and so are you—though he’s grown up, to call you such a term shows his impudence. You’re supposed to be a proper…” Just then, as she spoke, her face reddened and she gave a slight smile. Baoyu, realizing the implication, said, “It’s hard to say—the common saying goes: ‘Among monks, many are filial sons.’ I suppose he’s simply clever and knows how to win hearts. If he doesn’t want to acknowledge me, I wouldn’t mind.” As he spoke, he began to tear open the note. Xiren laughed and said, “That little Yun is always so mischievous—always wanting to be noticed one moment and then hiding the next; it’s clear he has dubious intentions.” Baoyu was absorbed in reading the characters on the note and paid no heed to Xiren’s remarks. When Xiren saw him frowning, she smiled gently and shook her head. Eventually, growing rather impatient, she asked, “What does it say?” But Baoyu did not answer; he had already torn the note into several pieces. Seeing this, Xiren thought it best not to press further and asked, “After eating, why don’t you read a bit?” Baoyu said, “That silly Yun! What a scoundrel—messing about like this!” Noticing that his answer was off-topic, Xiren smiled mildly and inquired, “What exactly is going on?” Baoyu replied, “I asked him, ‘What are you doing?’ Let’s eat and then rest. My mind is in such a tizzy.” With that, he called for a little maid to light a fire and burned the torn pieces of the note. Soon, the little maids brought the meal, but Baoyu sat there in a daze. Xiren, both coaxing and chiding him, urged him to eat a bite before setting the food aside; yet he remained dejectedly slumped on his bed. Before long, tears suddenly welled up in him. At that moment, both Xiren and Mèiyuè were at a loss. Mèiyuè said, “What’s this about? What’s with all this talk of ‘Yun’ and ‘Yu’—it seems something has happened, leaving him acting so foolishly, crying one moment and laughing the next. If this drags on, how can anyone bear it?” As she spoke, she became genuinely distressed. Xiren, unable to help but smile, urged, “Oh, dear sister, don’t take it out on others. He can handle it on his own—what’s written on his note, is it really related to you?” Mèiyuè retorted, “Don’t lump everything together. Do you know what sort of nonsense is written on that note? Don’t twist it to suit your own case. If anything, it might even pertain to you!” Before Xiren could reply, Baoyu suddenly burst into laughter from his bed, jumped up, shook his clothes, and said, “Let’s go to sleep; enough of this fuss. Tomorrow I must get up early to study.” With that, he lay back down, and the night passed in silence. The next day, after Baoyu got up and groomed himself, he went off to the family school.
That might be acceptable, but he actually snatched all my money!” Baoyu laughed and said, “What’s a few coins anyway? Silly thing—stop fussing.” The two mumbled and eventually sat down. Xiren then sent Baoyu off to sleep, and that’s that. Meanwhile, after hearing Baoyu’s earlier words—which clearly alluded to him being “proposed” to—Xiren, fearing that Baoyu might become infatuated and say more foolish things, pretended not to know. Yet in her heart this matter troubled her deeply. Lying in bed that night, she devised a plan: perhaps she should visit Zijuan to see if there were any developments so that she might learn more. The next morning, after sending Baoyu off to school and after her own grooming, she leisurely made her way to the Xiaoxiang Pavilion. There she found Zijuan plucking flowers. Upon seeing Xiren enter, Zijuan greeted her with a smile, “Sister, are you sitting in your room?” Xiren replied, “I am. And you, little sister, plucking flowers? And what about the young lady?” Zijuan explained, “The young lady has just finished washing and is waiting for her medicinal decoction.” As Zijuan spoke, she accompanied Xiren inside, where they saw Daiyu sitting with a book. Xiren smiled and said, “The young lady needn’t trouble herself—she can sit and read. If our Baoyu could study as diligently as you do, wouldn’t that be splendid?” Daiyu smiled and put her book aside. Xueyan had already come in carrying a small tea tray with a cup of medicine and a cup of water, while a little maid came in behind with a basin for rinsing. Originally, when Xiren arrived, she intended to gauge the atmosphere and sat for a while without broaching any topic. She reasoned that since Daiyu was so sensitive, any probing might upset her further. After sitting for a while, she exchanged a few words and took her leave. As she reached the gate of the Hongyuan Courtyard, she saw two people standing there, and she hesitated to go forward. One of them, having seen her, hurried over. When Xiren looked, it turned out to be Chuo Yao. She asked, “What are you doing?” Chuo Yao replied, “Just now, Second Young Master Yun came with a note, saying it was for our Second Master to see, and I’m here waiting for the message.” Xiren said, “Baoyu is at school every day—don’t you know? What message could there be?” Chuo Yao laughed and said, “I told him, and he said to tell you, so you should be expecting his letter.” Just then, another person slowly shuffled over. Upon closer inspection, it was none other than Jia Yun, who sidled over. Recognizing him, Xiren quickly said to Chuo Yao, “Just tell him that I got it, and to have it delivered to Second Master when he returns.” Jia Yun had intended to speak with Xiren—merely to ingratiate himself—but not daring to be presumptuous, he ambled slowly. Standing not far apart, Xiren, upon saying those words, felt awkward to continue forward and thus turned away. Jia Yun, dejected, had no choice but to leave with Chuo Yao. That evening, when Baoyu returned to his room, Xiren said, “Today, little Yun came by the corridor.” Baoyu asked, “About what?” Xiren replied, “He also brought a note.” Baoyu said, “Where is it? Hand it over so I can see.” Mèiyuè went off to fetch it from some documents in the inner room. Baoyu took it and saw that on the cover it read, “Greetings from Uncle.” Baoyu said, “Why does this child no longer acknowledge me as his father?” Xiren asked, “What do you mean?” Baoyu replied, “The year before last when he sent me a white begonia, he addressed me as ‘Father’; but today the envelope cover says ‘Uncle’—has he now disowned me?” Xiren said, “He’s shameless, and so are you—though he’s grown up, to call you such a term shows his impudence.
I only came to ask for a few taels of silver, not to claim the family’s property – even my Xing family’s property is enough for my needs. But alas, I couldn’t get hold of any, so you all end up calling me broke!” Seeing him drunk, Jia Zhen quickly interjected with soothing words. Outside, Lady You and the others, having heard everything clearly, whispered to Silver Butterfly and the others, “Listen – this is the brother of the Mistress of the North Courtyard complaining. Clearly, even his own brothers are like this, so it is no wonder these people behave as they do.” While they were still listening, the people playing the “Driving Old Goats” game had also paused for a drink. One person then asked, “Who offended Uncle too? We didn’t catch it. Please, tell us, so we can judge.” Xing Dequan then repeated what the two serving children had said without interference. Taking it from him, one man said, “It’s infuriating – Uncle was right to be angry. I ask you, Uncle only lost a few taels of silver, nothing more—so why do you all ignore him?” Everyone burst into laughter. Xing Dequan also sputtered a mouthful of food and said, “You really are such a useless fellow—if you can’t even move, you resort to causing mischief.” Lady You, standing outside, listened and spat a quiet curse, “Listen to this shameless little scoundrel! After drowning himself in cheap liquor, what new tricks will he come up with next?” And with that, she went back inside to remove her makeup and rest. At the fourth watch, Jia Zhen finally dispersed and went to the Pei Feng Room. The next day, someone announced, “The watermelons and mooncakes are all prepared; we just need to divide and deliver them.” Jia Zhen then ordered Pei Feng, “Please see that Granny gets them delivered; I have other matters to attend to.” Pei Feng agreed, returned to Lady You, and distributed them one by one, dispatching people to deliver them. Soon Pei Feng said, “The master asks: Will Granny go out today or not? Since we are a family of filial piety, we cannot break the tradition on the fifteenth, and tonight it is just right for everyone to respond to the scene.” Lady You replied, “I really don’t wish to go out. Over there, Granny Zhu is ill again and Second Madam Lian is in bed; if I do not go, there will be even fewer people.” Pei Feng said, “The master says that even if Granny goes out, she should return early, and ask me to accompany her.” Lady You replied, “In that case, eat quickly so I can depart.” Pei Feng said, “The master said breakfast is to be eaten outside; please, Granny, eat on your own.” Lady You asked, “Who is out there today?” Pei Feng replied, “I hear there are two newcomers from Nanjing, though I don’t know who they are.” After that, they ate, changed clothes, and Lady You and the others returned to the Rong Mansion, not coming back until late. Sure enough, Jia Zhen cooked a pork dish and a whole portion of lamb, preparing a table full of vegetables, fruits, and assorted delicacies. In the Huifang Garden’s Conglü Tang, he led his wives and concubines to dine first, then laid out wine and feasted merrily under the moon. Around the first watch of the night, the sky was clear and the moon radiant, with the Milky Way faintly hidden. Jia Zhen then ordered Pei Feng and three others to join him at the table, where a row of attendants sat below, playing guessing games with coins. After a while, Jia Zhen, having drunk a bit too much and feeling cheerful, ordered a purple bamboo flute to be fetched, instructing Pei Feng to play it while the musicians and singers performed. The clear, graceful tones were deeply moving. After the performance, the order was resumed. By the time it was nearly the third watch, Jia Zhen’s alcohol level reached about eighty percent. As everyone added extra clothes and drank tea, changing cups and taking further draughts, suddenly from beneath the wall a long sigh was heard. Everyone listened intently, and their hair stood on end. Jia Zhen urgently shouted, “Who is there?” After several inquiries and no response, Lady You said, “It must be someone from the household outside the wall – we can’t be sure.” Jia Zhen retorted, “Nonsense!
As for arranging a marriage by force—it is out of the question. Besides, Baoyu is ill; we cannot have him wed for mere good luck. Let the two families agree, and since the children already carry a ‘golden and jade’ fate, there is no need to formally match them. Instead, choose an auspicious day, conduct a modest ceremony according to our customs—perhaps with twelve pairs of lanterns and an eight-person sedan chair to carry the bride, following the southern custom of a simple yet dignified wedding. That, I promise you, will count as a marriage. And as for Baoyu’s beloved, the young Miss Bao, she is of sound mind and good character; if a wise person were to counsel him, all would be well. He and Miss Bao get along; furthermore, the second mistress once remarked, ‘The golden lock on Miss Bao has been foretold by a monk—it signals that only when jade is present can marriage ensue.’ Who knows? Perhaps once Miss Bao comes forward, Baoyu might even be induced to reveal his jade, and all will fall into place. Would it not be our good fortune if each day passes better than the last?” Jia Zheng, though inwardly reluctant, dared not contradict his mother. With a strained smile he replied, “Old Mother, you have planned this so well. We must, however, instruct everyone at home not to let this become public knowledge. I fear the second mistress’s family may not consent; if they truly agree, we must follow your instructions.” Madam Wang said, “The second mistress’s side is under my protection—now go.” Jia Zheng left with a heavy heart. With his official duties overwhelming him—receiving credentials from the ministry, attending endless receptions, and fielding recommendations from friends—he eventually left Baoyu’s fate entirely in the hands of Jia Mu, Madam Wang, and Fengjie. As for Baoyu’s lodging, the room behind the Rongxi Hall that belonged to Madam Wang was allocated for him; all other matters were to be ignored. Once Jia Mu had settled on the plan, he sent word accordingly, and Jia Zheng only replied, “Very well.” This, however, is a later matter. Now, after meeting with Jia Zheng, Baoyu was taken by Xiren back to the inner kang. Since Jia Zheng was away and no one dared speak to Baoyu directly, he drifted off in a daze. Although Jia Mu and Jia Zheng had discussed his fate at length, Baoyu heard not a word—they all fell on deaf ears as he dozed. Meanwhile, Xiren and the others quietly absorbed every detail. Though some of the rumor reached their ears, they noted that Baochai had not yet arrived, and increasingly began to believe the truth. Hearing all this, Xiren’s heart, initially light with relief, turned troubled. She thought, “Truly, the higher-ups have eyes that see clearly—this arrangement suits our fate! If he agrees, I could be relieved of many burdens. But this man’s heart has always been set on Lin Guniang. Fortunately, he did not hear it, for if he did, who knows what chaos might ensue? If he were to behave as he did in his youthful folly—when, in the summer in the garden, he treated me as if I were Lin Guniang and confessed his secret heart, and then, when Zizhuan teased, he cried as if his life depended on it—if now we tell him that he is to marry Miss Bao, forsaking Lin Guniang... Only if he remains oblivious can it work. But if he understands, not only will it not restore his luck, it may even hasten his ruin! I must not speak further, or it will spell trouble for three people!” Resolute, Xiren planned that when Jia Zheng departed, she would have Qiu Wen watch over Baoyu and then quietly slip out to find Madam Wang. She then approached Madam Wang, and in hushed tones pleaded that they speak in the room behind Jia Mu’s quarters. Jia Mu, meanwhile, remained absorbed in planning the wedding rites, unconcerned about Baoyu’s state. Xiren and Madam Wang, once secluded in the inner room, fell to their knees and burst into tears. Not understanding at first, Madam Wang gently took Xiren’s hand and said, “What is this? Speak now—what grievance have you?” Xiren choked, “I shouldn’t speak, but I’m at my wit’s end!” “Speak slowly,” urged Madam Wang.
Anyone who wishes to do so must follow the proper rites. I, being kind-hearted, have vowed that all are equal in the Buddha’s eyes. Now, since a few girls, fatherless and far from home, have known both wealth and hardship from an early age, and now wish to escape their miseries by entering the order, then perhaps ‘turning back from the bitter sea’ and embracing the monastic life might indeed be their wish. But do not let me hinder such benevolence.” Being a kind soul herself, Madame Wang at first listened as if it were merely the ramblings of children; but with recent household troubles and news from Mrs. Xing that Yingchun’s family would soon be invited to stay for two days so that they might be seen, and with official channels already in motion, her heart grew heavy with matters beyond such trifles. Thus, she laughed and said, “Then you two shall take them as your apprentices.” Her two maternal aunts, hearing this, bowed deeply and exclaimed, “Excellent, excellent! In that case, our late madame’s merits are considerable indeed.” Madame Wang then said, “Inquire of him. If he is sincere, then come up here and formally become a disciple in my presence.” The three girls who had gone out eventually returned with the three young apprentices. Madame Wang questioned them repeatedly; once they made up their minds, they kowtowed with the two aunts and then excused themselves. Seeing that their minds were determined and that she could no longer force the matter, Madame Wang’s anger softened into pity. She quickly ordered that some gifts be gathered for them and also sent gifts to the two aunts. From that day onward, Fangguan became attached to Zhì Tōng of Shuiyue Temple, while Rui Guan and Ou Guan went with Yuán Xìn of Dizang Temple; the three of them subsequently left home and entered the monastic life. Now, as for what follows, we shall continue in the next installment. Chapter 79: Xue Wenqi’s Regret at Marrying a Ferocious “River-Dong” and Jia Yingchun’s Mistaken Marriage to a “Zhongshan Wolf”  After Bao Yu had just finished offering sacrifices for Qingwen, a sound of voices was suddenly heard from beneath the flowering shade—which startled everyone. Looking closely, it was none other than Daiyu herself, with a smiling countenance as she said, “What a novel eulogy! It could stand alongside the ‘Cao E Stele’ in renown.” Bao Yu, hearing this, blushed and laughed, “I thought that all the traditional memorial inscriptions have become stale, so I tried to create something new. It was merely a fleeting fancy of mine, and who would have thought you would hear it! There is nothing untoward in modifying it—why not refine it a bit?” Daiyu replied, “Where is your original draft? I would like to examine it in detail. It is a long, elaborate piece—I only caught the middle couplet, which goes ‘Within the red silk curtains, the young master’s affection runs deep; in the yellow earth on the hills, the daughter’s fate is thin’—and that line is rather fine. But ‘within the red silk curtains’ seems too commonplace. Given that there is an already existing true story, why not use that instead?” Bao Yu hurriedly asked, “What true story do you mean?” Daiyu smiled and said, “Since our windows are now draped in rosy gauze, why not say, ‘Beneath the scarlet gauze window, the young master is exceedingly amorous’?” Bao Yu couldn’t help but stamp his foot in laughter, “Excellent, excellent! It shows you can come up with such ideas. Clearly, the world abounds with ready-made splendid scenes and events; it is only we simpletons who fail to think of them. Yet even if this revised version is extraordinarily clever, it suits you here while you remain—but I truly cannot claim credit for it.” He added humbly, “I dare not take full credit.” Daiyu laughed, “No matter—I may well let my window serve as your window; there is no need to make a formal distinction, that would only seem too distant and unfamiliar. Even in ancient times when strangers met, one might say ‘a fine horse in light garments can be worn without regret’—how much more so for us?” Bao Yu replied, “In relationships, it is not about fine horses or delicate silks; even gold and jade are not measured by mere pennies.
After Jia Zheng inquired about the details, he could only offer vague responses, saying that they would wait until Xue Ke submitted his memorial and see how the county authorities would rule before proceeding further. Meanwhile, Madam Xue had already exchanged silver at the pawnshop and sent the junior servant off with it. Three days later, a reply finally arrived. Madam Xue immediately called a young maid to fetch Baochai so they could read the letter together. The letter read as follows:  “The silver has been used to cover the official fees at the county office. My brother, though in custody, is not suffering greatly—please do reassure the mistress. However, the officials here are very exacting; even the close relatives acting as witnesses refuse to cooperate, and even the friend our brother called upon is assisting them. Since Li Xiang and I are native-born, we were fortunate to find a gentleman who, for a sum of silver, has offered us a plan. He suggests that if we can coerce Wu Liang—who was drinking with our brother that very night—to testify, and offer him some silver to ‘tear up’ the confession, then if he refuses, we can blame the death on a certain Zhang San, an outsider. If Wu Liang cannot stomach it, then all will be settled. I followed his advice, and sure enough, Wu Liang came forward. Now, a witness has been arranged and another memorial has been drafted; it was submitted the day before yesterday and approved today. Please see the memorial for details.” And the memorial continued with these words: “I, the undersigned, hereby present this petition concerning my brother’s tragic misfortune and the redress of his grievance: My dear blood-brother, Xue Pan, originally from Nanjing but residing in the Western Capital, departed on business down south on [a certain date]. Not long after, a family servant delivered a letter saying that he had been ‘killed’—and he immediately rushed to the authorities. Upon arrival in prison, our brother tearfully confessed that he had accidentally injured a man surnamed Zhang. In the ensuing interrogations, he insisted that he had never harbored any enmity against Zhang; indeed, the two had no prior grudge. It happened by chance at a wine-drinking quarrel when, as our brother flung down his wine, Zhang San happened to be bending over to pick something up; in that moment, the wine bowl accidentally struck his head, causing his death. Fearing punishment, our brother, under duress, admitted that a fight had broken out. In his plea for mercy, he has cited the Emperor’s benevolence; however, no verdict has yet been reached. With our brother still in confinement, I now submit this statement on his behalf, risking life and limb. I humbly beg for the Emperor’s gracious favor in allowing a formal re-examination of the evidence. Our entire family shall remain forever in your debt.” The ruling read: “The post-mortem examination of the corpse has confirmed the evidence beyond doubt. Moreover, no torture was administered, and your brother himself confessed to the fight leading to death. Since you are far removed from the incident and did not witness it, you cannot be expected to fabricate evidence. According to the law, he should be convicted. However, taking into account your brother’s plight, we shall be lenient. Case closed—petition denied.” Upon hearing these words, Madam Xue exclaimed, “Isn’t this hopeless? How can this be acceptable?” Baochai interjected, “You haven’t finished reading the rest of Second Brother’s letter yet; there’s more.” Then she recited further: “The matter hinges on one crucial question; further inquiries will reveal everything.” Madam Xue then questioned the messenger, “So what is it they want?” He replied, “The county has known for some time that our family’s assets are ample. They require us to secure an influential position in the capital and present an even larger gift, so that the case may be reexamined and our brother’s sentence lightened. The mistress must act quickly—any further delay might result in our eldest uncle suffering unduly.” Hearing this, Madam Xue sent the junior servant off once more to explain the situation to the Jia household by way of Madame Wang, earnestly pleading with Jia Zheng. Jia Zheng would only agree to have his acquaintances intercede with the county magistrate, and he refused to mention any money. Fearing that this would prove ineffective, Madam Xue sought help from Sister Feng and Jia Lian, spending several thousand silver taels to bribe the county magistrate. Soon, Xue Ke’s side also managed to reach an understanding.
Earlier, the mistress ordered Yuan-Yang to ensure that if any maid dares joke with you, they must follow the example of Qingwen and Si Qi.” Xiren then added sadly, “I fear your heart must be heavy.” Bao Yu quickly reassured her, “Dear sister, rest assured—I will study if that is what is required. I have many maids such as Meiyue and Autumn-Pattern to keep me company. You should take your rest.” Xiren smiled and then departed. Bao Yu, now troubled, eventually returned to Grandmother Jia’s side. Grandmother Jia, having just finished her midday rest, asked him, “Why did you finish school so early today?” Bao Yu recounted Jia Zheng’s lecture on his recent performance and his new instructions regarding the “test compositions” his teacher had ordered him to prepare. Grandmother Jia beamed with delight. Bao Yu then inquired of everyone, “Where is my elder sister sitting?”  Madame Xue (Sèxiǎnmā) replied with a laugh, “Your elder sister has not come; she’s busy working with Xiang Feng.” Bao Yu’s heart sank, and he felt empty inside. Soon, dinner was served in the house—with Grandmother Jia, Madame Xue, and the others seated, while Fengjie handled the service. Madame Xue then mentioned, “Earlier, someone asked about Xiang Feng—apparently, she changed her name.” Madame Xue’s face flushed fiercely, and with a heavy sigh, she said, “Don’t bring it up again. Ever since Pan’er married that ungrateful fellow, there’s been endless bickering—and now people say she isn’t suitable because of her name.” Grandmother Jia interjected, “What’s in a name?” Madame Xue continued tearfully, “I fear our young lady must be sent away if this scandal spreads.” Grandmother Jia urged, “Just let it be; speak no more of it.”  At this point, Jia Zheng had finished testing Bao Yu’s compositions. He then asked him about his progress, and Bao Yu hesitantly recited three pieces he had prepared: one titled “At Fifteen, I Resolve to Study,” another “Not Angered by Ignorance,” and a third simply “Thus, I Turn to Ink.” Jia Zheng inquired if these were in written form. Bao Yu confirmed they were copies revised by his teacher. Jia Zheng then ordered, “Fetch those manuscripts from the study.” Soon, Bei-Ming (Bei-Míng) brought them, and Jia Zheng scrutinized the first composition. Originally, the text read “The Sage is driven by a resolve from youth,” but his teacher had replaced the word “youth” with “fifteen.” Jia Zheng commented, “Using ‘youth’ would not clearly set the proper age. For a sage, stating ‘at fifteen’ is more precise.” He then looked over the second work, which was titled “Not Angered by Ignorance.” After a brief discussion on its merits and faults, Jia Zheng asked, “And what of your third composition, ‘Thus, I Turn to Ink’?” Bao Yu explained that he had been discussing with his teacher how, when there is nothing else to rely on, one must resort to ink—a subtle reference to the inevitability of literary creation. Jia Zheng, with his arms folded, stood by the door lost in thought. At that moment a small page scurried by and halted when he saw Jia Zheng. When asked what he was doing, the page replied, “The old lady has sent word that the ladies are to be served dinner, so please hurry.” Jia Zheng did not press further, and the page scurried away. Just then, Bao Yu recalled that ever since Bao Chai moved back home, he had been pining for her. In haste, he said, “I’ve composed a test piece already—but I’m not sure if it’s good enough!” Jia Zheng replied, “Recite it for me.”  Bao Yu read:    “Not all men are scholars; truly, the truly productive are few.”  Jia Zheng nodded approvingly, “That works, though you must now devote yourself more earnestly to writing.
Could it be that he and our Qin-sister have been involved in some improper affair, and have thus contrived this ploy to drag my name through the mud? Who can say?” The thought sent a shiver down his spine. Lost in these troubled musings, he suddenly heard a muffled laugh from outside—a sound that startled him greatly. Who uttered it remains to be revealed in the next installment. Chapter 93: As Baocan Schemes Amid Licentious Designs, While Baoyu Foolishly Ruminates on Zen  It happened that while Xue Ke was still deep in his anxious thoughts, he suddenly heard a laugh outside his window. Startled, he thought, “It can’t be Baocan—it must be Jin Gui.” Yet, he resolved not to pay them any further heed, waiting to see what trick they might play. For a long while he strained his ears, but there was only silence. Unwilling to even partake of the wine and fruit, he shut his door. Just as he was about to undress, he heard a slight rustle on the window paper. Already having been toyed with by Baocan the previous night, Xue Ke’s heart pounded with confusion and uncertainty. Listening intently to the faint sound, he looked closely, but found no movement—only then did suspicion seize him. He sank onto a chair by the lamp, turning over a piece of fruit in his hand as he pondered. Suddenly, he glanced back and discovered that a portion of the paper on the window was damp. Approaching it to inspect, a cold gust blew from outside accompanied by a series of creaking, laughing sounds that startled him greatly. In his fright, Xue Ke quickly blew out the lamp and lay perfectly still, holding his breath. From outside, a voice cried, “Second Master, why do you not drink your wine and eat your fruit before going to sleep?” The tone unmistakably echoed Baocan’s. Xue Ke, feigning sleep, remained silent. A couple more remarks followed—one, in a tone of bitter reproach, exclaimed, “What man in all the world is so hapless?” The words seemed to be uttered partly by Baocan and partly by Jin Gui, and Xue Ke understood their meaning at last. He tossed and turned in his thoughts until he finally managed to sleep after the fifth watch. At dawn, someone knocked at his door. Xue Ke called out, “Who is it?” but received no answer. Reluctantly, he rose and opened the door to find Baocan standing there, his hair disheveled and his arms wrapped around himself. He was dressed in a tight-fitting jacket with gold-trimmed pipa-style collar, secured by a half-new, pine-green sweatband; below, he wore no skirt at all, revealing stone-pomegranate–red embroidered breeches and a pair of newly embroidered red shoes. It turned out Baocan had not yet washed up and had come early to collect his things. Seeing him thus attired, Xue Ke invited him in with a polite smile and asked, “What brings you up so early?”  Baocan blushed and said nothing, but simply folded the fruit into a small dish and departed. Observing his departure, Xue Ke surmised that whatever had transpired the previous night had been set in motion. He thought, “So be it; if they are angry enough, they may have completely made up their minds—and that spares me the trouble of further entanglement.” With his heart at last easing, he ordered someone to fetch water to wash his face and resolved to remain at home for a few days to recuperate, fearing that if he ventured out, someone might come looking for him. Meanwhile, those who had long been on friendly terms with Xue Pan—seeing that the Xue household was empty except for the young, inexperienced Xue Ke—began to covet his position. Some schemed to insert themselves as errand runners; others, capable of serving as assistants or scribes, hoped to manage his affairs; still others planned to extort money from him; and there were even those who spread menacing rumors. Xue Ke, noticing these intruders from afar, did his best to avoid them, though he dared not confront them directly for fear of provoking an unforeseen calamity. Instead, he hid within his home, awaiting further developments—a matter he did not elaborate on. That very night, Jin Gui had sent Baocan some wine and fruit to “probe” Xue Ke’s condition, and Baocan returned and recounted every detail of Xue Ke’s plight.
If you love someone, simply keep them in your room so that no one sees you behaving indecently. What do I want with such nonsense?” Xue Pan, delighted by her words, thanked her profusely. That very night, in a display of all that a husband might do to please his wife, Xue Pan spared no effort in fawning over Jin Gui. The next day he stayed home, engaging in boisterous antics that emboldened him even further. By mid-afternoon, Jin Gui purposely went out, leaving an opening for the two to be alone. Xue Pan then began to pull and cajole her, and Baochan—aware of what was about to happen—half-heartedly complied. Just as they were about to depart for a secret rendezvous, Jin Gui, having anticipated the moment, called a little maid (a boy servant known as Xiao She’er) over. This little maid, who had been in Jin Gui’s service since childhood – orphaned early and known affectionately as “Little She’er” for doing rough work – was summoned by Jin Gui with the order, “Go tell Qiu Ling to come to my room and fetch my silk cloth; do not mention that I said so.” Xiao She’er hurried off to find Qiu Ling, saying, “Miss Ling, the madam’s silk cloth was forgotten in the room. Please go get it and bring it up—it would be well.” Qiu Ling, who had been trying to salvage Jin Gui’s recent setbacks (and did not quite know what to make of the situation), rushed in to retrieve the cloth. Alas, as she was about to hand it over, she collided with the two in a rush, and her face flushed bright red with embarrassment as she quickly turned away. Xue Pan, feeling he had made his move, considered himself successful – for besides Jin Gui, no one else was to be feared, and he left the door unlatched. At that moment Qiu Ling arrived; although she was not overly perturbed, Baochan – who was known for her stubborn tongue – could not help but resent the encounter, accusing him of “using force.” Xue Pan, having barely managed to placate her, found himself ultimately rebuffed by Qiu Ling, who pushed him away and fled, bitterly cursing that he was “using his strength to force his way.” Though Xue Pan had almost managed to win her over, Qiu Ling’s rejection transformed his initial excitement into outright fury, and he vented all his anger on her. Without further ado, he rushed out, hurling insults at Qiu Ling, calling her “a damned harlot!” and accusing her of “roaming like a ghost among the dead.” Qiu Ling, fearing further trouble, scampered off. Xue Pan later sought Baochan again but found no trace of her. Enraged, he cursed Qiu Ling. That evening, after dinner, when Xue Pan had become thoroughly drunk, while bathing he discovered the water was slightly too hot and scalded his feet—then he claimed that Qiu Ling had deliberately done this to harm him. Stripped bare, he charged at Qiu Ling and struck her twice. Though Qiu Ling did not suffer long from this, by that time she was forced to resign herself, gathering her few belongings and leaving. At this point, Jin Gui secretly informed Baochan that tonight Xue Pan was to be “married” in Qiu Ling’s room – that is, she was ordered to accompany Jin Gui in bed. At first Qiu Ling refused, but Jin Gui scolded that she was being too fussy and, fearing that the labor at night would be too much, insisted. She was also rebuked, “Have you not seen how our master behaves? He takes every opportunity to monopolize my maidservants, and he never allows you to come near – what is your plan? I fear you intend to drive me to despair!” Xue Pan, alarmed that such matters might spoil Baochan’s reputation, quickly returned to berate Qiu Ling, “If you do not come, I will beat you!” Reluctantly, Qiu Ling had no choice but to bring her bedding. Jin Gui then ordered her to lie down on the ground; Qiu Ling complied. No sooner had she laid down than she was summoned for tea repeatedly throughout the night, and her legs were beaten several times so that she could not rest comfortably. Xue Pan, having secured Baochan as if it were a treasure, disregarded all else and became entirely obsessed with her.
Yet she could not help but feel sorrow under the moonlight, and by lamplight she quietly lamented. Although she had spent several years in Xue Pan’s household, her delicate condition – worsened by her inherited illness – meant she never bore children; now, further aggravated by anger and distress, her health declined, and she eventually developed a “dry blood” disorder, growing thinner and losing her appetite with no remedy proving effective. Meanwhile, Jin Gui continued to quarrel with Xue Pan. On occasion, emboldened by wine, he confronted her twice. When he tried to strike with a stick, Jin Gui dodged and ordered him away. When he nearly drew a knife, she stretched out her neck defiantly. Unable to bring himself to hit her, Xue Pan raged for a while before giving up. Over time, this became habitual, and Jin Gui’s insults toward Baochan grew ever more severe. Baochan, who could not compare with Xiangling, was like dry tinder; having bonded with Xue Pan through shared feelings, he completely disregarded Jin Gui. Outraged by her continual mistreatment, Baochan refused to relent. At first there were verbal spats and shoving; later Jin Gui’s anger escalated to physical blows. Though Baochan dared not retaliate, he began to thrash about as if courting death – by day with knives and scissors, by night with ropes – causing endless commotion. Xue Pan, caught between loyalties he could not resolve, eventually stood helplessly by, thoroughly exasperated, and left the house in despair. Jin Gui, meanwhile, secretly explained to Baochan that that very night Xue Pan was to be “married” in Qiu Ling’s room – meaning that she was forced to accompany him in bed. At first Qiu Ling refused, but Jin Gui insisted that she must not be too particular about comfort in the dark hours. She scolded, “Have you not seen our master? He clutches his maidservants so tightly that no one may approach you – what is your plan? I fear you intend to ruin me!” Worried that this might spoil Baochan’s reputation, Xue Pan quickly returned and admonished Qiu Ling, “If you do not obey, I will beat you!” With no alternative, Qiu Ling had to gather her bedding and lie down on the floor, reluctantly obeying. No sooner had she settled than she was repeatedly summoned for tea throughout the night, and her legs were struck several times so that she could not rest a moment. Xue Pan, having secured Baochan as if he were a treasure, ignored all else. In his bitterness, Jin Gui murmured, “Let him have his fun for a few days; when he grows distant, then I can arrange Xiangling as I wish. Then Baochan, originally mine, will be of no consequence.” Quietly enduring, she schemed to further control Qiu Ling. After about half a month, Qiu Ling suddenly feigned illness, complaining of unbearable heartache and immobility with treatments proving ineffective. Everyone remarked that it was due to her suppressed anger. After two days, unexpectedly, someone discovered a paper effigy hidden among Jin Gui’s pillows – inscribed with her age and an eight-character phrase, with five needles pinned into her chest and between her ribs and limbs. Thus the household took it as news and reported it first to Aunt Xue. Aunt Xue grew frantic, and Xue Pan became even more disordered, threatening to interrogate everyone. Jin Gui said, “There is no need to wrong the innocent; it appears that Baochan’s ‘demon-repelling charm’ must be employed.” Xue Pan replied, “But she has not spent much time in your room lately; why cling to a good woman?” Jin Gui sneered, “Who else is there? Am I not the only one? Even if there were others, who would dare enter my room?” Xue Pan said, “Now that Qiu Ling follows you every day, she surely knows; ask her and you will find out.” Jin Gui laughed coldly, “Ask whom? Who will confess? In my view, they will all pretend not to know – so let it drop. Besides, even if I were punished to death, it matters little; I could always remarry someone better. Truly, if you complain, who will not blame me?” Tears streaming down, she continued, “Then why must you involve everyone? I fear I will be blamed if you persist.” Xue Pan’s anger mounted further, and he seized a door bolt, stormed off, and without further ado confronted Qiu Ling, accusing her bluntly.
Impatient, Zhou Ruijia urged, and the two finally dispersed. Si Qi, still sobbing, pleaded, “Please, dear aunts, show me some compassion. Let me go and bid farewell to my dear friend sister – after all, for these years we have been close.” Zhou Ruijia and his companions, all occupied with their own tasks, replied scornfully, “I advise you to leave; do not dither! We have serious matters to attend to. Who do you think you are, crawling out from your own garment? Why must you say farewell to them? You’ll only be delayed for a little while—does that count for nothing?” Irritated, he said, “Hurry up and go!” As he spoke, he led her out the rear corner gate. Unable to protest further, Si Qi followed. Just then, Bao Yu, returning from outside, saw that Si Qi was being led out with many belongings; he suspected that she was being sent away for good. Hearing the nighttime events and that Qingwen’s illness had worsened that day, he asked Qingwen in detail—but she would not say why. Now, seeing Si Qi departing, Bao Yu, overcome with grief as if he had lost his soul, hurried to stop them and asked, “Where are you going?” Zhou Ruijia and the others, well aware of Bao Yu’s past behavior and fearing that prying might cause further trouble, laughed and said, “It is none of your business—hurry and study.” Bao Yu, laughing nervously, said, “Sisters, please wait a moment—I have something to say.” Zhou Ruijia retorted, “Madame has ordered that you must not waste time. What reason could you possibly have? We only know what Madame says and cannot meddle further.” Si Qi, upon seeing Bao Yu, clutched him and cried, “What great misfortune have you done? Please, tell me—please, I beg you!” Bao Yu, with tears in his eyes, said, “I do not know what terrible deed you have committed! Qingwen is so ill, and now you are about to leave—what shall we do?” Zhou Ruijia, growing impatient, said to Si Qi, “If you do not behave as a proper lady now, I will beat you. Don’t think that you can hide behind your previous privileges and avoid your due punishment! Even if you must be a little noisy for a while, that is inevitable!” Some of the women, without waiting for further words, seized Si Qi and dragged her out. Bao Yu, fearing that they might report everything, glared after them until they were out of sight, muttering bitterly, “How strange—how strange! How is it that once a woman is married and takes on the scent of a man, she becomes so shameless, even more so than a man himself?” An old gatekeeper, overhearing, laughed and asked, “So you’re saying that all daughters are good, but every woman is wicked?” Bao Yu fumed, “Yes, yes!” Just then, several old women came in and said, “Everyone, be careful and attend to the household. At this moment, the madame herself is coming to inspect the garden.” They then ordered, “Quickly call the brothers and sisters from the Yihong Courtyard so that they may escort her out.” They added with laughter, “Ah, Amitabha! Today, once the heavens open their eyes and send this wicked little imp away, everyone will be at peace.” Bao Yu, upon hearing that Madame Wang was coming for a thorough search, was certain that even Qingwen would not be spared, and quickly fled—but later, in the midst of his anxious words, he heard nothing further. Later that night, at dawn, a little maidservant from Madame Wang’s room opened the front corner door and conveyed Madame Wang’s orders: “Immediately rouse Bao Yu; wash your face and change your clothes. For today someone has invited the master to admire the autumn chrysanthemums. Since the master enjoyed the poem you composed the other day, he wants to take them with him.” She added, “Huan’er has already arrived. Hurry up and go—I am off to call Lan’er now.” The old women inside, responding in turn, fastened their buttons and opened the door. Hearing the summons, Yingren knew something was afoot and immediately sent for the water to wash his face, urging Bao Yu to get up and groom himself.
But when he observed Baocan’s furtive, uneasy manner, he began to wonder. “Could it be,” he thought, “that since Baocan is of the Mistress’s household, he might have his own considerations? Perhaps he is too shy to speak plainly, and by invoking Jin Gui’s name he hopes to divert attention. Or perhaps, given that he is a member of my brother’s household, there is more to it than meets the eye…” Suddenly, another thought struck him: “That Jin Gui, who has never adhered to the strict codes of propriety in the inner quarters—and who sometimes, in a fit of gaiety, dresses in an outrageously coquettish manner, convinced of his own beauty—might harbor ill intentions. Could it be that he and our Qin-sister have been involved in some untoward affair, and have thus contrived this ploy to sully my name? Who can tell?” The thought made him shudder with apprehension. While he was lost in these troubled musings, he suddenly heard a muffled laugh from outside the window—a sound that startled him. Who uttered it remains to be revealed in the next installment. Chapter 91: As Baocan Schemes Amid Licentious Designs, and Baoyu Foolishly Ruminates on Zen  It happened that Xue Ke was in a state of deep uncertainty when suddenly he heard a laugh from outside his window. Startled, his heart pounded as he thought, “It can’t be Baocan—it must be Jin Gui.” Determined not to pay them any mind, he resolved to see what mischief they might be up to. For a long while, though he strained to listen, there was only silence. Too unsettled to partake in the wine and fruits, he shut his door. Just as he began to undress, he heard a faint rustling on the window paper. Already having been dallied with by Baocan the night before, Xue Ke’s mood turned tumultuous, leaving him unsure what to do. The sound on the window persisted, yet when he looked closely, there was no movement. His suspicions grew; he sat by the lamp, turning a piece of fruit over and over in his hand. Suddenly, he glanced back and noticed that a section of the paper on the window was damp. As he moved closer to inspect, a sudden gust blew from outside, and he was startled by a series of creaking, laughing sounds. In a panic, Xue Ke swiftly extinguished the lamp and lay perfectly still, holding his breath. From outside, a voice called out, “Why, Second Master, do you not drink or eat your fruit before you sleep?” The voice unmistakably echoed Baocan’s tone. Xue Ke remained silent, pretending to be asleep. After another couple of remarks—one in an angry tone proclaiming, “What man in the world is so unfortunately made?”—Xue Ke, recognizing that the voices belonged partly to Baocan and partly perhaps to Jin Gui, realized their true intent. He turned the matter over in his mind until after the fifth watch he finally managed to sleep. At daybreak, someone knocked at the door. Xue Ke hurriedly asked, “Who is it?” but no answer came. Reluctantly, he got up and opened the door to find Baocan standing there. Baocan, with his hair tousled and his arms wrapped around himself, was dressed in a finely tailored, tight-fitting jacket with delicate gold-trimmed pipa-collar, secured by a half-new, pine-green sweatband. He wore no skirt underneath, exposing stone-pomegranate red embroidered breeches, and his feet were clad in newly embroidered red shoes. It turned out that Baocan had not yet had time to wash up and had come early to collect his belongings. Seeing him so attired, Xue Ke invited him in with a cordial smile and asked, “What brings you up so early?”  Baocan blushed and, offering no answer, simply folded the fruit into a small dish and departed. Observing Baocan’s appearance, Xue Ke sensed that last night’s matter had been set in motion; he thought, “So be it. If they have grown angry, they may have decided beyond reconciliation—and that spares me the trouble of further entanglement.” Relieved, he relaxed and ordered someone to fetch water for washing his face. He resolved then to remain at home for a couple of days to recuperate, for fear of being sought out by others if he went out. Meanwhile, those who had long been allied with Xue Pan in high spirits—seeing that no one was present at the Xue household except for the young and inexperienced Xue Ke—began to covet his position.
At dawn the next day, just as Jia Zheng was about to leave his office, the hall was distributed with two booklets of provincial market estimates, which he had to inspect immediately. Unable to return home at once, he sent someone back to inform Jia Lian, saying: “Lai Da is back. You must question him thoroughly. Handle the matter as you see fit; there’s no need to wait for me.”  Jia Lian, following orders, though fond of Qin’er, reasoned to himself, “If we handle it too discretely, Jia Zheng might become suspicious. It would be better to go back to Second Madam Ming and ask for her advice. Then if it goes against the old master’s wishes, at least I won’t be held accountable.” Having made up his mind, he went inside to see Madam Wang and explained: “Yesterday, the old master got angry upon seeing that notice and called Qin’er along with the nun-like women and Taoist women into the mansion for inquiry. Today, the old master doesn’t have time to address this inappropriate matter and has sent me back to you to decide on how to handle it. I have come to seek your instructions on this affair.”  Madam Wang was taken aback and said, “What do you mean? If Qin’er behaves in this way, can he still be regarded as one of our family? And that notice itself is repugnant—the words are nothing but a jumble. Have you asked Qin’er whether this matter really occurred?”  Jia Lian replied, “I have just inquired. Madam, even if he didn’t actually do it, who in their right mind would undertake such a scoundrel’s work? Yet I think Qin’er wouldn’t dare to act thus: he knows that those girls were only desired by the mistress for a short time. What if something goes wrong? In my humble opinion, if we ask and it comes out, Madam, how do you propose we handle it?”  Madam Wang asked, “Where are those girls now?”  Jia Lian answered, “They are all locked in the garden.”  “Do the young ladies know?” asked Madam Wang. “They seem to think it’s a matter pertaining to the palace, and nothing else is mentioned outside,” Jia Lian explained. “Very well. This matter cannot be delayed even for a moment. Initially I intended to send them away, but you all insisted they be kept. Now that trouble has arisen, you must tell Lai Da to go back to his original establishment and inquire carefully whether there are any of his kin involved. Get the official documents checked, spend perhaps a few dozen taels of silver to hire a boat and assign a reliable person to deliver everything back to their home, and also return all the documents. That way nothing will be amiss. If, however, it turns out that one or two bad apples have reverted to secular ways, then to detain everyone would be too grievous a sin. And if the matter were to be made public to the authorities—even if we forgo our dowries—if they sell the jade, who would care about their lives? As for Qin’er, give him a good scolding; aside from the ancestral rites and celebrations, he need not be summoned here. Should he inadvertently come into conflict with the old master’s anger, he’ll be in deep trouble. Also, inform the accounts office to cancel the entry for this item of grain and provisions. Then, send someone to Shuiyue Nunnery to relay the old master’s command that aside from the ritual of burning paper for the ancestors, no man from his family is allowed to enter. Should there be any more unfavorable news, even the old maid must be expelled as well.”  Jia Lian agreed to every word. He then went out to relay Madam Wang’s orders to Lai Da, saying, “Madam’s instructions are for you to proceed exactly as she said. Once you have finished, report back to me so I can in turn report to Madam. Hurry on and complete the task. When the old master returns, you must answer according to Madam’s directions.”  Hearing this, Lai Da remarked, “Our Madam truly has a compassionate heart. Yet to have these people sent back… if they’re forced to be sent, Madam must choose someone capable. Qin Ge’er will be handed over to Second Master for punishment.
Do you know what sort of nonsense is written on that note? Don’t twist it to suit your own case. If anything, it might even pertain to you!” Before Xiren could reply, Baoyu suddenly burst into laughter from his bed, jumped up, shook his clothes, and said, “Let’s go to sleep; enough of this fuss. Tomorrow I must get up early to study.” With that, he lay back down, and the night passed in silence. The next day, after Baoyu got up and groomed himself, he went off to the family school. Stepping out of the courtyard, he suddenly remembered and called out to Bei Ming and the others, “Where is Sister Mèiyuè?” Mèiyuè, coming out, asked, “Why have you returned?” Baoyu said, “Today Yun is coming; tell him not to cause a ruckus here. If he does, I’ll have to report back to Grandmother and Grandfather.” Mèiyuè assented, and Baoyu turned to leave. Just as he was about to go out, he saw Jia Yun hurrying in. Upon seeing Baoyu, he quickly greeted, “Uncle, what joyful news!” Baoyu, suspecting it was about yesterday’s incident, said, “You’re too rash! Whether one has something on his mind or not, you still come to stir things up.” Jia Yun smiled and said, “Uncle, if you don’t believe it, just wait and see. Everyone’s already gathered at our main gate.” Baoyu grew increasingly anxious and asked, “Who said that?” At that moment, voices erupted outside. Jia Yun remarked, “Uncle, can you hear that?” Baoyu’s suspicions deepened. Then a voice shouted, “You all have no manners! What is this place? Why are you all making such a clamor?” Another voice replied, “Who wouldn’t call out when the master has been promoted? How could we not come to celebrate? Other families long for such joy too.” Realizing that the news was of Jia Zheng’s promotion to Langzhong and that people had come to report the happy tidings, Baoyu’s heart filled with joy. Just as he was about to leave, Jia Yun hurriedly said, “Uncle, aren’t you happy? Your proposal will go through once again—it’s a double celebration, needless to say.” Baoyu blushed and spat, “Bah! You ridiculous fellow! Hurry up and leave!” Jia Yun’s face reddened, and he stammered, “There’s nothing wrong with it—I thought you, sir, might not…” Baoyu, with a stern expression, said, “Not what?” Jia Yun, unable to finish his sentence, fell silent. Baoyu quickly made his way to the family school, where the substitute teacher smiled and said, “I just heard that your father has been promoted—are you here today?” Baoyu smiled and replied, “I came to see the great master; I wanted to pay my respects to my father’s side.” The substitute teacher said, “There’s no need for you to come today; you have a day off. But do not return to the garden to play. You’re not a child anymore—though you cannot manage affairs, you should at least learn from your elder brothers.” Baoyu agreed and left. As he reached the second gate, he saw Li Gui coming over and stopping beside him, smiling, “Second Master, have you arrived? The servant was just about to call you to the school.” Baoyu laughed, “Who said that?” Li Gui replied, “Grandmother sent someone out to look for you in the courtyard. The young ladies said that Second Master had gone to school. Just a while ago, Grandmother sent someone out to ask for a few days off for you. I heard you’re even supposed to perform a celebratory play. So you came.” With that, Baoyu went inside. Upon entering the second gate, he saw that all the maids and servants were beaming; when they saw him, they exclaimed, “Second Master, you’re only coming so late? Hurry inside and congratulate Grandmother!” Baoyu smiled as he entered.
Jin Gui, meanwhile, secretly explained to Baochan that that very night Xue Pan was to be “married” in Qiu Ling’s room – meaning she was to be forced to accompany him. At first Qiu Ling refused, but Jin Gui insisted that she must not be too particular about comfort in the dark hours. She scolded, “Have you not seen our master? He hoards his maidservants so that none can approach you – what is your plan? I fear you intend to drive me to ruin!” Worried that this might spoil Baochan’s reputation, Xue Pan quickly returned and admonished Qiu Ling, “If you do not obey, I will beat you!” With no alternative, Qiu Ling had to gather her bedding and lie down on the floor, reluctantly obeying. No sooner had she settled than she was repeatedly called for tea throughout the night, and her legs were struck several times so that she could not rest. Xue Pan, having secured Baochan as if he were a treasure, ignored all else. In his bitterness, Jin Gui murmured, “Let him have his fun for a few days; when he grows distant, I can then manipulate Xiangling, and Baochan—originally mine—will be of no consequence.” Quietly enduring, she schemed further to control Qiu Ling. After about half a month, Qiu Ling suddenly pretended to be ill, complaining of unbearable heartache and immobility with treatments proving ineffective. Everyone remarked that it was her suppressed anger. After two days, unexpectedly, someone discovered a paper effigy hidden among Jin Gui’s pillows – bearing her age and an eight-character inscription, with five needles pinned into her heart and between her ribs and limbs. Thus the household took it as news and reported it first to Aunt Xue. Aunt Xue grew frantic, and Xue Pan became even more disordered, threatening to interrogate everyone. Jin Gui said, “There is no need to wrong the innocent; it appears that Baochan’s ‘demon-repelling charm’ must be employed.” Xue Pan replied, “But she has not spent much time in your room lately; why cling to a good woman?” Jin Gui sneered, “Who else is there? Am I not the only one? Even if there were others, who would dare enter my room?” Xue Pan said, “Now that Qiu Ling follows you every day, she surely knows; question her and you will find out.” Jin Gui laughed coldly, “Question whom? Who will confess? In my opinion, they will all pretend not to know – so let it drop. Besides, even if I were to be punished to death, it matters little; I could always remarry someone better. Truly, if you complain, who will not blame me?” With tears streaming down, she continued, “Then why must you involve everyone? I fear I will be blamed if you persist.” Xue Pan’s anger mounted further, and he seized a door bolt, stormed off, and without further ado confronted Qiu Ling, accusing her bluntly. Qiu Ling cried out in protest. Aunt Xue rushed in and commanded, “Do not start beating her until you know the whole truth! This maidservant has served for years—wasn’t there a time when she made a mistake? Would you really be so heartless? Ask clearly first, then act!” Hearing this, Jin Gui feared that Xue Pan might soften and began to weep bitterly, “For half a month you have monopolized my Baochan, kept her from entering my room, and only allowed Qiu Ling to sleep with me. I wish to question Baochan, yet you continue protecting him. Now you act so defiantly as to beat her—if you kill me, then remarry as you please; why must you put on this farce?” Xue Pan’s anger grew even more. Aunt Xue, seeing how her daughter-in-law oppressed her son, cursed bitterly. In her fury she ordered, “Sell Xiangling immediately!” Miss Bao then laughed, “Our family only knows how to buy people, not sell them—madam, you are completely confused. If word gets out, won’t it be a laughingstock? If my elder brother and sister-in-law despise her and leave her to me, I’m doomed!” Aunt Xue replied, “Better to dismiss her entirely than allow her to remain with us.” Miss Bao laughed, “Whether she stays with me or not is immaterial—cut her off as if she were sold.” Xiangling had already run up to Aunt Xue, pleading bitterly and crying, unwilling to leave; she wished instead to remain with the young lady.
When the pawnshop people examined it, they found many paper effigies along with seven balls of red embroidered needles. They sent it to the Jinyi Mansion, where high officials in charge of large households were questioned about the private affairs of many families. As a result, documents of clay figurines of demons were uncovered, and several boxes of incense were found. Behind an empty room hung a seven-star lamp, beneath which several straw figures stood—some with headbands, some with nails on their chests, and some with chains around their necks. In a cabinet, countless paper effigies were stored. Small ledgers recorded that a certain household was inspected and fined a certain amount of silver; expenses for oil and incense were incalculable.”  Fengjie said, “It seems our troubles indeed stem from him. I recall that after we fell ill, that old fiend came several times to Aunt Zhao’s, begging for silver, and when he saw me his face changed and his eyes resembled those of a frightened bird. I had guessed the reason then, but now it appears there was indeed cause. Yet as long as I am in charge here, there will naturally be grievances—no wonder people are angry with me. Bao Yu has no enemies; how can I endure such harsh treatment? It is unbearable!”  Grandmother Jia said, “Who knows—perhaps it is because I care so deeply for Bao Yu and Huan’er that I have inadvertently caused you troubles?” Madame Wang replied, “What can one do when faced with an ignorant person? When our elders are not properly informed, the details cannot be acknowledged; if the matter becomes public, it would bring disgrace. Let him suffer his fate—eventually, he will expose himself.” Grandmother Jia said, “You speak truly. Without proper evidence, nothing can be decided. But listen—our very own afflicted ones are worse off than most. Never mind what happened in the past, Fengjie, you need not mention it further. Today, after you and your madame have had dinner with me, you may go.”  Then Grandmother Jia ordered Yuanyang, Hupo, and others to serve the meal. Fengjie quickly laughed, “Why is it that the old matriarch is suddenly so concerned?” Madame Wang also laughed. At that moment, several wife-servants arrived. Fengjie quickly told the little maidservants, “I, along with my madame, will eat with Grandmother after dinner.” Just then, Yuchuan came and told Madame Wang, “The old master is seeking something—please attend once Grandmother’s meal is finished; go and find it.” Grandmother Jia said, “You go ahead; do not worry about the old master’s urgent matters.” Madame Wang agreed, leaving Fengjie to attend, and then returned to her own room. In her room, Madame Wang chatted with Jia Zheng about trivial matters and had the items searched for. Jia Zheng then asked, “Has Ying’er returned? How is she faring at the Sun family?” Madame Wang replied, “Young Ying has been weeping bitterly, saying that Uncle Sun is terribly fierce.” She then recounted Ying’er’s story. Jia Zheng sighed, “I knew it was not right, but Grandfather has already decided that there is nothing I can do. Ying’er must endure some grievances.” Madame Wang said, “But she is a new bride; we only hope that she will eventually thrive.” Laughing, Jia Zheng said, “What are you laughing about?” Madame Wang recounted Bao Yu’s words humorously. Jia Zheng couldn’t help but laugh and then said, “Speaking of Bao Yu, I recall something. This child, kept roaming the garden, is not doing well. If a daughter is unproductive, it is trivial; but if she is productive, it matters greatly. Recently, someone mentioned a certain gentleman from the south—a man of learning and exemplary character. I think that gentleman is very gentle. Our city children, though clever, are impetuous; if such a gentleman continues to act foolishly, it would be a waste. That is why our elders have refused to hire an external teacher, preferring instead to choose someone from within the family with some experience to teach the children. Now, although our venerable master’s scholarship is only average, he still manages to keep these young ones in check, so that they do not waste their lives.” Jia Zheng said, “Indeed; for now we only require that Bao Yu study—recite, compose essays.
Now you act so defiantly as to beat her—if you kill me, then go ahead and remarry someone better; why must you put on this show?” Xue Pan’s anger grew even more. Aunt Xue, seeing how his daughter-in-law was oppressing her son, cursed bitterly. In her fury she ordered, “Sell Xiangling immediately!” Miss Bao then laughed, “Our family only knows how to buy, not sell—madam, you are all confused. If word gets out, won’t it be a laughingstock? If my elder brother and sister-in-law despise her and leave her to me, I’m doomed!” Aunt Xue replied, “Better to dismiss her entirely than let her remain with us.” Miss Bao laughed, “Whether she stays with me or not makes no difference—cut her off as if she were sold.” Xiangling had already run up to Aunt Xue, pleading bitterly and crying, unwilling to leave; she wished instead to remain with the young lady. Aunt Xue, with no alternative, had to relent. Thereafter, Xiangling indeed left with Miss Bao, effectively severing her previous ties. Yet she could not help but feel sorrow under the moonlight, and by lamplight she lamented quietly. Although she had spent several years in Xue Pan’s household, her delicate condition – compounded by her inherent illness – meant she never bore children; now, further agitated by anger and emotional strain, her health declined, and she eventually developed a “dry blood” disorder, growing thinner and losing her appetite, with no remedy proving effective. At that time, Jin Gui repeatedly quarreled with Xue Pan. On occasion, bolstered by wine, Xue Pan would even confront her twice. When he attempted to strike with a stick, Jin Gui evaded and ordered him away. When he nearly drew a knife to kill, she stretched out her neck defiantly. Xue Pan, unable to bring himself to strike her, raged for a while before giving up. Over time this became habitual, and it even led Jin Gui to increasingly insult Baochan. Baochan, who could not compare with Xiangling, was like dry tinder; having bonded with Xue Pan through shared feelings, he completely disregarded Jin Gui. Enraged by Jin Gui’s continual mistreatment, Baochan refused to back down. At first there were quarrels and shoving; later Jin Gui’s anger escalated to insults, and then even physical blows. Though Baochan dared not retaliate, he began to roll and thrash as if courting death, employing knives and scissors by day and ropes by night – causing endless commotion. Xue Pan, caught in a predicament he could not resolve, ended up standing by helplessly, thoroughly exasperated, and eventually left the house in despair. Jin Gui, meanwhile, secretly explained to Baochan that that very night Xue Pan was to be “married” in Qiu Ling’s room – meaning that she was ordered to accompany him in bed. At first Qiu Ling refused, but Jin Gui insisted that she must not be so particular about comfort, as it would only invite laziness in the dark hours. She further scolded, “Have you not seen our master? He clutches his maidservants so tightly that you cannot get near – what is your plan? I fear you intend to drive me to ruin!” Xue Pan, worried that this might ruin Baochan’s reputation, quickly returned and admonished Qiu Ling, “If you do not obey, I will beat you!” Qiu Ling, with no choice, had to gather her bedding and lie down on the floor, reluctantly obeying. No sooner had she settled than she was repeatedly called for tea throughout the night, and her legs were struck several times so that she could not rest for a moment. Xue Pan, having secured Baochan as if he were a treasure, ignored all else. In his bitterness, Jin Gui murmured, “Let him have his fun for a few days; when he grows distant, then I can arrange Xiangling as I wish. Then Baochan, originally mine, will be of no consequence.” Quietly enduring, she schemed to further manipulate Qiu Ling. After about half a month, Qiu Ling suddenly feigned illness, complaining of unbearable heartache and immobility, with treatments proving ineffective. Everyone remarked that it was due to her suppressed anger. After two days, unexpectedly, someone discovered a paper effigy hidden among Jin Gui’s pillows – inscribed with her age and an eight-character formula, with five needles pinned into her chest and between her ribs and limbs.
Yuanyang exclaimed in surprise, “I haven’t heard a word about that. Go and ask Second Madam—she’ll know.”  As they were speaking, two women from the Fu Shi household came over to pay their respects to Jia Mu. Yuanyang intended to accompany them. Since Jia Mu was napping, the two women whispered a word to Yuanyang and then departed. Zizhuan asked, “Who sent them?”  Yuanyang replied irritably, “How tiresome! Our household now has a girl, a rather pretty one, who is paraded like a treasure. She is always praised before the old lady—how well-born, how kind-hearted, ‘well-mannered, eloquent, skillful at work, literate and numerate, most filial to her elders and even exceedingly kind to the servants.’ They come with a whole spiel to extol her virtues to the old lady. I find it so annoying. These gossipy old women are extremely tiresome, yet the old lady loves to hear such flattery. The old lady is one thing, but Baoyu, who’s seen these women so often, has grown rather tired of them. Yet she holds a special preference for those whose wives are not tiresome—how strange, isn’t it? The other day she even said: ‘Among the families that have come to propose for their daughters, the master never consents; his heart is set on only marrying into a family like ours.’ After a round of praises and flattery, the old lady is completely won over.”  Zizhuan was dumbfounded for a moment, then feigned a question, “If the old lady likes her so much, why not fix her on Baoyu already?”  Just as Yuanyang was about to explain, someone from inside called, “The old lady is awake!” Yuanyang hurried upstairs, and Zizhuan had to follow. Back in the garden, as she walked, Zizhuan mused, “Isn’t there only one Baoyu in the world? You think of him, and so do I. Our own person is growing ever more infatuated! Judging by that expression, she must have her eyes set on Baoyu—those repeated illnesses, aren’t they due to this matter? With all the ‘gold’ and ‘silver’ in the household in disarray, now add in some Miss Fu—it’s just too extraordinary. I reckon Baoyu’s heart might be with our girl as well. Listening to Yuanyang, he seems to fall for every pretty face. Isn’t it that we girls have all been fretting in vain?”  Zizhuan had originally been thinking of Daiyu, but soon found herself at a loss as to whom to favor, her mind clouded with infatuation. She wished she could tell Daiyu not to worry, yet feared that might only add to her distress; seeing Daiyu like this was indeed pitiful. After much vacillation, she became agitated and scolded herself, “Why do you waste your worry on others? Even if Lin Miss truly is made for Baoyu, his temperament is hard to restrain. Though Baoyu is of a gentle nature, he tends to bite off more than he can chew. I advise that we need not fuss over it—my own worry is enough. From now on, I’ll devote myself entirely to serving our girl, and let everything else go.” With that thought, she felt a sense of relief. Returning to the Xiaoxiang Pavilion, she found Daiyu sitting alone on the kang, revising her old manuscripts of poems and essays. Lifting her head as she saw Zizhuan enter, Daiyu asked, “Where have you been?”  Zizhuan replied, “Today I visited the other sisters.”  “Were you looking for Sister Xiren?” Daiyu inquired. Zizhuan said, “Why should I look for her?”  For a moment, Daiyu wondered, “How did that slip out so easily?” Feeling somewhat embarrassed, she retorted, “Whether you look or not is none of your concern! Go serve some tea.”  Zizhuan silently chuckled and went off to fetch tea. Suddenly, a clamor arose in the garden, the source unknown. While serving tea, Zizhuan sent someone to investigate. The messenger soon reported: “In the Yihong Courtyard, several of the Haitang trees had withered from neglect, with no one attending to them.
Madam Wang, observing this scene, was moved to tears—but in Jia Mu’s presence she dared not speak a word. Sensing Madam Wang’s distress, Jia Mu said, “You may return; I will see to it that he is attended to. When the old master returns tonight, inform him that he need not come to see me—he must remain silent.” After Madam Wang left, Jia Mu summoned Yuanyang to fetch some tranquilizing and spirit-settling medicine, which was administered according to prescription—nothing more was said. That evening, as Jia Zheng returned home, he overheard on the carriage that a Taoist monk was saying, “For a man to make his fortune is an easy matter.” One asked, “How do you know so?” The monk replied, “Today I heard that at the Rong Mansion, some sort of jade of a certain size and color was lost—a notice was posted saying that whoever delivered it would receive 10,000 taels of silver, with an extra 5,000 for the bearer of the letter.” Jia Zheng, though he hadn’t caught every word clearly, was astonished. He hurried back and called for someone at the door to inquire about the matter. The gatekeeper reported, “I, too, had no idea until midday when Second Master Lian conveyed the old lady’s message, and that’s when the notice was posted.” Jia Zheng sighed, “Our family’s fortunes are waning! And yet to have such a wretched thing—a cursed child—raised here! When he was a child, rumors abounded in the streets; after more than ten years they subsided a bit. And now, we’re out here publicly hunting for jade—what is the meaning of this!” He then briskly went inside to question Madam Wang. Madam Wang recounted every detail. Knowing it was the old lady’s idea, Jia Zheng dared not oppose it—though he grumbled a few words to Madam Wang. Later, he went out again and secretly had the posted notice taken down, hiding it from the old lady. But it turned out that idle gossipers had already removed it. After a while, someone came to the Rong Mansion gate claiming to have delivered the jade. The family, upon hearing this, were delighted and said, “Bring it in, so we can return it to you.” The man then produced the reward notice from inside his pocket and showed it to the gatekeepers, saying, “Isn’t this your family’s notice? It states that whoever delivers the jade will receive 10,000 taels of silver. Second Master, do you think I’m poor? Once I have the silver, I’ll be rich—don’t treat me with such disregard.” The gatekeeper, taking him at his word, said, “Show me the jade so I can return it to our master.” At first the man hesitated, but later, hearing that it was proper, he took out the jade and held it aloft in his palm, asking, “Isn’t this it?” The family, mostly serving outside and rarely in possession of such a jade, were awestruck as they examined its appearance. They rushed inside to report it. That day, when Jia Zheng and Jia She had been out, only Jia Lian was at home. When they returned, Jia Lian asked, “Is it genuine?” A gatekeeper replied, “I saw it with my own eyes. But I cannot hand it over without first showing it to our master—one hand for the silver, the other for the jade.” Jia Lian was delighted. He quickly reported to Madam Wang, and later to Jia Mu, while Xiren clapped her hands in joyful prayer. Jia Mu, however, was unyielding. He ordered, “Hurry, have Lian’er invite that man into the study so we may examine the jade. If it is as stated, we will pay him the silver immediately.” Following orders, Jia Lian invited the man in and treated him as a guest, thanking him profusely: “If I may borrow this jade until I present it to our master—and I promise not to shortchange you in silver—please.” The man had no choice but to send over a package wrapped in red silk. When Jia Lian unwrapped it, was it not the same translucent, beautiful jade? Jia Lian, who had never been one to question such things, now took a keen look.
I thought you should know—listen carefully tomorrow when the Master speaks with you.”  After saying this, she turns and leaves. Xiren orders that she be kept to drink tea (fearing that if the door is closed she might be trapped), and Little Que is sent off. Baoyu, upon hearing this, realizes that Zhao Yiniang’s intentions are as deceitful as those of his foes. Not understanding what exactly was said, he feels a sudden, unsettling tightness in his limbs and all over his body—as if the magical headband of Sun Wukong had been tightened. After musing over his predicament and lamenting that he had not been diligent in his studies (“I ought to have reviewed my texts every day!”), he resigns himself to his limited repertoire—only being able to recite a few portions of “Xue,” “Yong,” and parts of the “Lun,” while much of the “Mengzi” and the “Five Classics” remain half-memorized. Even the ancient texts and historical writings he once studied have faded into vague recollections, and his knowledge of the eight-legged essay remains unsatisfactory. As a result, his anxiety grows, for if he must review one text he fears he might neglect another, and he finds it impossible to properly rehearse them all in one night. His efforts to study not only prove fruitless but also disturb the entire household of maids—preventing them from getting any sleep. While Xiren and others trim candles and serve tea, the little maids grow drowsy, slumping about. Qingwen scolds them: “What clumsy little brats you are! All day you loll about like lifeless corpses. If you oversleep even a little, you start putting on airs—if you continue, I’ll have to prick you with a needle!” Barely finished speaking, they suddenly hear a thud from outside. Rushing to look, they find a young maid who had been tapping her wrist has accidentally bumped her head against a wall, jolting her from sleep. At that very moment, as Qingwen finishes her threat, the maid, mistaking the situation as if Qingwen had struck her, bursts into tears and pleads, “Oh, dear sister, I won’t dare again!” Everyone laughs. Baoyu quickly intercedes, “Leave her be. She should simply be allowed to sleep. You all should take turns sleeping as well.” Xiren chides, “Little Master, just mind your own business! For tonight, devote your heart to these few books—once we get through this, you can resume your other tasks. It won’t harm anything.” Baoyu, moved by her earnest tone, reads a few more lines from his book. Miaoyue pours a cup of tea to soothe his throat, which Baoyu accepts. Noticing that Miaoyue is wearing only a short jacket, Baoyu remarks, “It’s so chilly now—shouldn’t you wear a proper coat?” Miaoyue laughs and gestures toward her book, “Forget about us for now; let your mind focus on your studies.”  Before long, Spring Yan and Qiu Wen burst in from the back room, shouting, “It’s terrible! Someone just jumped off the wall!” The crowd rushes to ask, “Where?” and everyone scurries off to search. Qingwen, noticing Baoyu’s distressed expression as he studies with a pained look, resolves to come up with a solution to help him overcome his anxiety. Suddenly, she suggests, “Seize this chance—feign illness and say you were startled!” Her suggestion strikes a chord in Baoyu’s heart. He then summons the night watchmen, and with lanterns in hand, they search the premises. Yet no one is found; some whisper that the young maids may have mistaken someone in the dark. Qingwen retorts, “Don’t talk nonsense! Your search isn’t thorough—if you’re not careful, it will only cause more trouble. I know what I saw when I went out with Baoyu; everyone witnessed it. Now look at him—he’s pale and feverish! I must go upstairs and fetch some spirit-calming medicine immediately. If the mistress asks, we must explain clearly—how can you just dismiss it?” Hearing this, the others are struck silent and, fearing the worst, disperse to search once more. Qingwen and Qiu Wen head out to fetch medicine, and their alarmed cries soon spread the news that Baoyu has been so frightened that he’s fallen ill.
And even if others come to seek your help later, who would dare force you?” Miaoyu gave a slight smile and then ordered the incense attendant to light incense. He rummaged in a box for the sand-table and spirit board, wrote a talisman, and instructed Xiuyan in the rites. After she had performed the necessary bows and prayers, Miaoyu and Xiuyan together proceeded with the spirit-writing. Before long, the spirit wrote:    Ah! In coming, leave no trace; in departing, not a mark remains. Beneath the ancient pine at the foot of Qinggeng Peak—   Chase it if you will, though countless mountains lie in your way;   Enter my door and share a smile, and all shall be revealed. When the writing was complete, and the spirit-writing session ended, Xiuyan asked, “Which immortal was summoned?” Miaoyu answered, “The ‘Wayward Immortal’.” Xiuyan recorded the words and went to seek Miaoyu’s further explanation. But Miaoyu replied, “I cannot say any more; even I do not fully understand. You must take this along—there are many clever people out there.” Xiuyan had no choice but to return empty-handed. Entering the courtyard, everyone asked, “What did it say?” Xiuyan, without time to detail everything, simply handed the spirit-writing scroll to Li Wan. All the sisters and Baoyu crowded around to read it, and they interpreted its meaning as: “Though you search for it now, it cannot be found; yet once lost, it shall not remain so forever. But where is Qinggeng Peak?” Li Wan mused, “This is an immortal riddle. How could a Qinggeng Peak ever emerge within our household? It must be that someone, fearful of being discovered, has hidden it beneath a stone where a pine grows. Yet the line ‘enter my door’—whose door is meant here?” Daiyu asked, “I wonder, whose immortal are we summoning?” Xiuyan answered, “The Wayward Immortal.” Tan Chun remarked, “If it is an immortal’s door, then it is hard to enter.” Xiren, anxious, began to search high and low—peeking under every stone—but to no avail. Returning to the courtyard, Baoyu made no further inquiry but only smiled foolishly. Mesha fretted, “Little ancestor, exactly where did you lose it? Explain yourself! Otherwise, we will all be punished, and our disgrace will be out in the open.” Baoyu laughed, “I said it was lost out there; yet you all refuse to believe me. Now you ask me—how could I possibly know?” Li Wan and Tan Chun said, “It’s already past the second watch of the night. Look—Miss Lin has lost her composure and gone her own way. We should rest; let the matter be discussed again tomorrow.” With that, the crowd dispersed. Baoyu soon retired for the night, still smiling in his foolish way. Poor Xiren and the others wept and pondered, lying awake the whole night—no detail is worth recounting here. Meanwhile, Daiyu returned to her room and recalled the old tales about “gold” and “jade.” This filled her with a secret delight as she mused, “The words of monks and priests are hardly to be trusted. If indeed ‘gold’ and ‘jade’ are fated, how could Baoyu possibly lose this jade? Or perhaps it is because of me that their destined union is being undone…” Lost in thought for a long while, she felt strangely at ease and dismissed the day’s weariness, resuming her reading. Zizhuan, feeling drowsy, urged Daiyu to sleep. Yet as Daiyu lay down, her thoughts drifted to the Haitang flower. “This jade was born with me—it is no ordinary object, and its comings and goings are fated. If this flower is to herald good fortune, surely the jade should not be lost. Perhaps this unusual blooming portends misfortune—could it be that something ominous is about to occur?” she murmured, and her heart grew heavy. In her alternating moods of sorrow and joy, she finally dozed off around the fifth watch. The next day, Madam Wang and the others sent people early to the pawnshops to inquire, and Fengjie secretly sought it as well.
The maid unwrapped it to reveal that it contained a bundle of plain paper on which the ‘Heart Sutra’ was written. She then picked up a small container of incense, saying, “This is used to light the incense when one is writing the sutras.” Xi‑chun responded in agreement. Yuanyang then took her leave and, accompanied by the little maid, went to Grandmother Jia’s room to report. There they found Grandmother Jia playing a board game of Chinese checkers (lianglu) with Li Wan. Yuanyang lingered at the side to watch. Li Wan’s dice were particularly good, and each throw knocked down several pieces of Grandmother Jia’s hammer-mark. Yuanyang smiled softly. Just then, Baoyu entered carrying two delicate, slender silk baskets. Inside the baskets were several crickets. He announced, “I heard that Grandmother has trouble sleeping at night, so I’ve brought these to help keep her company.”  Grandmother Jia laughed, “Don’t think that just because your father isn’t home you can be mischievous—you simply amuse me with your antics.”  Baoyu protested, “I’m not being mischievous.”  Grandmother Jia chided, “If you’re not being mischievous, then why, instead of studying in your study, are you fussing with these trinkets?”  Baoyu explained, “It wasn’t my idea at all. Earlier today, Master had asked Huan and Lan to compose couplets. Huan couldn’t come up with one, so I quietly told him a few lines. He reported it to Master, who liked it and complimented him. In gratitude, Huan purchased these for me so I could offer them to Grandmother as a token of filial piety.”  Grandmother Jia then said, “He’s supposed to be studying every day—why can’t he compose couplets? And if he can’t, then send him to Ru Da Ye to have his mouth smacked to teach him some shame. You’re enough to bear it yourself, and don’t you remember when your father was home, reciting poetry and lyrics so energetically he resembled a little imp? Now you go on talking again. That little fellow Huan is even more useless—he has someone else write for him, yet he finds new ways to create trouble. Such a child, making a fuss over trivial matters without a hint of shame! Soon he’ll grow up and become something unmanageable.”  The whole room burst into laughter. Grandmother Jia then inquired, “And what of little Lan—has he managed to compose? It seems Huan has done it on his behalf, though he is even younger, isn’t that so?”  Baoyu laughed, “He hasn’t, but he managed to produce a couplet by himself.”  Grandmother Jia said, “I find that hard to believe—otherwise it must be that you’ve stirred up some mischief again. Nowadays, you are the only one in the flock who stands out like a camel among sheep; you seem to have started composing essays again.”  Baoyu laughed, “It truly was his work. Master even praised him, saying he will surely be successful someday. Grandmother, if you don’t believe him, send for him so that you can test him for yourself—and then you will know.”  Grandmother Jia replied, “I do like it when that happens. I only worry you might be lying. If it is indeed his work, then perhaps he will show some promise.”  Looking toward Li Wan, Grandmother Jia recalled Jia Zhu, “This mustn’t be in vain because of your elder brother’s death. Your elder sister-in-law managed him so well, and in the future, she will stand in as the pillar of the family.” Tears welled in her eyes as she spoke. Li Wan, touched by her words, also became emotional, though Grandmother Jia’s sorrow quickly had her holding back her tears and smiling to console her, “This is the residual grace of our ancestors. We live on their blessings. As long as our elder brother has earned their favor, it is our destiny. If our ancestors approve, then how can we be sorrowful?” She then turned to Baoyu, “Do be careful not to praise him too much tomorrow, for he is just a child and does not know any better.
I did not set out to fight him. I only splashed wine at him because he refused to have his wine replaced. I did not intend to hit him; it was a misfortune—a careless accident. In a panic, I tried to staunch his bleeding, but when I realized that I could not stem the flow and his blood was gushing, he died shortly thereafter. At the mortuary the other day, fearing Your Honor’s anger, I claimed that I had smashed the bowl on him. I only beg for your mercy!” The magistrate roared, “You muddle-brained fellow! First you claim you hit him because he wouldn’t change his wine, and now you claim it was an accidental blow! Enough with your shifting stories!” Feigning a show of force as if to beat him further, the magistrate ordered the coroner to “fill out the injury report exactly as observed at the mortuary.” The coroner reported, “Upon examination the other day, Zhang San’s body showed no bruises except for a mark at the fontanel area measuring approximately 1.7 inches long and 0.5 inch deep, with the skin split open. The fontanel bone was fragile and had a break over about 0.3 inches. It appears to have been a bump injury.” The magistrate compared the wound with the testimony, and, had the documents not already been revised to be lenient, would have pressed further. Instead, he hastily ordered that the testimony be recorded. Zhang Wang cried out, “Good heavens, Your Honor! I recall there being more injuries—how come now there’s only this one?” The magistrate replied, “This woman is talking nonsense! Look at the wound you see here—don’t you understand?” He then called upon Zhang Er, saying, “Tell me, how many injuries did you notice on your nephew’s body?” Zhang Er hastily replied, “There was one injury on his head.” The magistrate pressed, “There is more!” He then summoned a clerk to show Zhang Wang the injury report and asked the constable and Zhang Er to confirm it. “As you see, the witnesses at the mortuary all testified that there was no fight; it was merely an accidental injury. The instructions were simply to record it as such. Xue Pan is to be held in custody for further investigation. The rest of the witnesses are to be dismissed.” Zhang Wang wailed and ranted, but the magistrate ordered the constables to drive her out. Zhang Er then consoled her, “It was truly an accident—how can you pin the blame on someone else? Now that Your Honor has made his ruling, cease your clamor.” Outside, Xue Ke received word of the verdict and was secretly pleased. He sent a messenger home with a letter, stating that once the full approval arrived, they could make arrangements for his brother’s redemption and secure his release. Along the way, whispers spread: “A noble consort has passed away— the Emperor has suspended court for three days.” Since the mausoleum was not far away, the county magistrate, busy with his duties, thought it best not to delay here. He returned to the prison and told our eldest uncle, “Rest assured, I’m going home now. I’ll return in a few days.” Xue Pan, also fearing his mother’s anguish, sent word that “I am well; it will only take a few more official procedures before I can go home. Just do not fret over the silver.” Xue Ke left Li Xiang behind to see things through and headed home, where he met with Madam Xue. He explained how the county magistrate had shown partiality and had finally ruled that it was an accidental injury. He added, “They mentioned that with some additional silver paid to the witnesses, the case could be fully redeemed.” Upon hearing this, Madam Xue was temporarily relieved, saying, “I was hoping you’d come home soon to see to things. The Jia household was scheduled to send their thanks, but with the recent death of Consort Zhou, the mansion has been rather empty. I was thinking of going over to help see to the Concubine’s affairs—at least to keep her company—but since no one is here, your timely return is most welcome.” Xue Ke replied, “I was away and heard that Jia Fei had passed away—only now have I hurried back. Our ‘Madame’ is well, so how could she die?” Madam Xue explained, “Last year, she had fallen ill once but recovered.
That insolent servant is unbelievable!” After a brief exchange, Fengjie left to sit elsewhere, and later returned home. Once in her room, she summoned Ping’er and retrieved for Xiuyan a set of new clothes—a small red gauze jacket, a light frock trimmed with pearl embroidery in a soft, pine-green fabric, a sapphire-blue skirt woven with brocade, and a vest in a cool silver-mouse pattern. She had them carefully wrapped and sent off. Meanwhile, Xiuyan, still rattled by the old woman’s clamor, though held in check by Fengjie’s admonitions, could not settle her troubled mind. She thought, “So many of our sisters are here, yet none of the servants dare offend him; only I, left alone, am subjected to their idle chatter. Ever since Fengjie’s confrontation, my mind is in turmoil.” In the end, feeling utterly empty, she could say nothing more. Just then, as she was lost in thought and weeping silently, Fengjie’s maid Feng’er arrived bearing clothes. Xiuyan looked at them and resolutely refused to accept them. Feng’er said, “The Mistress has ordered me to bring you something; if you disdain these old garments, then please accept the new ones.” Xiuyan smiled and said, “I appreciate our Mistress’s kindness. But since I have already lost my clothes, and now they have been given to me, I dare not accept them. Please return them, and extend my sincere thanks to our Mistress—I consider it as if I have already received her favor.” She then pressed a small purse into Feng’er’s hand. Feng’er had no choice but to accept it and leave. Before long, Ping’er and Feng’er returned; Xiuyan greeted them warmly and sat down for tea. Ping’er laughed, “Our Mistress said that you are extraordinarily refined, Miss!” Xiuyan replied, “Not refined, merely indifferent.” Ping’er said, “But our Mistress remarked, ‘If the girl does not accept these garments, it means she considers them too old—or she looks down upon our Mistress.’ Just now, when I said I would take them back, our Mistress did not agree.” Xiuyan blushed and laughed, “In that case, I dare not refuse.” They exchanged tea and continued. Meanwhile, at the home of Madam Xue, chaos reigned as Jin Gui had stirred up a great commotion. Upon hearing the matter of Xiuyan’s lost garment, both Baochai and her mother wept bitterly. Baochai said, “It is all because our brother is not here, and so Miss Xing must endure extra hardship. We are fortunate that Sister Feng is so capable. We must remain vigilant—after all, they are all our kin.” At that moment, Xue Ke entered and said, “Our eldest brother, all these years abroad, has consorted with the most disreputable company! Not a single upright person among them—all are scoundrels! I have seen to it that in recent days I have driven them out. I shall continue to gather news.” Madam Xue lamented, “Though I have a son, it now feels as if I have none at all. Even if the authorities approve, he is useless. You, my nephew, are wiser than your elder brother—I now place all my hopes in you. Learn well henceforth. Moreover, the daughter-in-law you have taken has diminished our family’s fortunes. A girl’s marriage is never an easy matter—if all she expects is a capable husband, then her future is assured. But if Miss Xing turns out like this…” She trailed off, gesturing inwardly. “I won’t say more. Miss Xing truly is a girl of both modest means and self-respect. Once our affairs are settled, and your proper matters concluded, I too shall have one less worry.” Xue Ke replied, “Sister, the matter of Qin’s (the zither-playing sister’s) departure has troubled the Mistress greatly. As for that matter—what is there to say?” The conversation continued in idle tones. Later, Xue Ke returned to his own room. After dinner, he recalled that Xiuyan, now living in the Jia Garden, was a poor orphan forced to rely on the goodwill of others, and that her daily needs were barely met. Having known her since the day she arrived—with her appearance and character well understood—he could only sigh over the injustice of fate: how could one like the affluent and spoiled Xia Jinguai be so blessed while a gentle soul like Xiuyan must endure hardship?
Doesn’t Grandmother find these matters amusing?”  Madame Feng frowned, “These remarks are not amusing—they’re alarming. Our household is not what it used to be. As the saying goes, ‘One’s fame makes one fat as a pig.’ Yet these are mere empty titles, and in time no one will know what to make of them.”  Zhou Ruiguai replied, “Grandmother is right. But tea houses, taverns, and alleyways all spread such talk. It has been so long that no one can keep everyone silent.” Madame Feng nodded. Then she called upon Ping’er to count out a few taels of silver and handed them to Zhou Ruiguai, saying, “Take these to Ziyuan—simply say I’m providing funds for purchases. If the officials ask about the monthly allowance, just say it’s mine.” Zhou Ruiguai accepted the silver and promised to deliver the message without further comment. Soon after, Jia Lian went outside and was met by a young page who reported, “Grandfather called for Second Master to speak.” Jia Lian hurried over and met with Jia Zhen. Jia Zhen said, “It is said that in the palace the Imperial Physician and two officials went to examine a patient—they were not among the palace maids or servants. Lately, in the palace there have been rumors of misfortune with the Empress Dowager’s household. Which household’s affairs are they speaking of?”  Jia Lian answered, “They were referring to the Jia household.”  Jia Zhen replied, “Then you must ask your Second Master and dear brother; if not, send someone to the Imperial Hospital to inquire.” Jia Lian said, “I’ve already sent someone to inquire there.”  Before long, at midday, while the inquiries were still pending, messengers came in reporting, “Two officials from the Department of Internal Affairs are waiting outside to see you, gentlemen.”  Jia Zhen said, “Please, come in.” The messengers brought the officials in. Jia Zhen and Jia Lian led them outside, first offering greetings to the ladies. Then, after seating everyone in the great hall, an official announced that “by decree, on the morrow at the designated time, the palace will receive four male relatives to be inspected. Each shall be accompanied by one maid; the remaining men shall not be admitted. They are to remain outside and present only their titles when greeting. They must enter at the designated time in the morning and exit in the afternoon.”  Jia Lian and Jia Zhen stood silently, then sat down again after the official finished his instructions and saw that the tea had been served. The official then departed. Jia Lian and Jia Zhen then escorted everyone back to Grandmother’s side and reported the decree to her. Grandmother Jia said, “Among our relatives there should be four. Which one is missing?” None dared answer. After a moment’s thought, she remarked, “It must be Fengjie—she always is so attentive to these matters. Now, discuss it among yourselves.”  Jia Lian and Jia Zhen agreed, and they ordered the household to prepare four sedan chairs, more than ten cars with emerald canopies, all to be ready at dawn. The staff responded promptly. Jia Lian and Jia Zhen then returned to report to Grandmother Jia, “You will be received at the palace at the appointed times in the morning and afternoon. Rest now, for tomorrow you must rise early to prepare for your journey into the palace.”  Grandmother Jia said, “I understand; go on.”  Later, Mrs. Xing, Madame Wang, and Fengjie spoke at length about Yuanfei’s illness and other trivial matters, then dispersed. The next morning, all the maids had lit the lanterns, the mistresses were groomed, and all the gentlemen were properly attired. At the first cockcrow, Lin Zhi-xiao and Lai Da entered and reported at the gate, “The sedan chairs are all set out front.” Soon after, Jia Zhen, Mrs. Xing, and others arrived. After breakfast, Fengjie was the first to escort Grandmother out, and everyone proceeded slowly. Meanwhile, Li Gui and several others were sent by the palace to escort the family. Approaching the palace gate, they saw several senior officials sitting there.
He ordered, “Hurry, have Lian’er invite that man into the study so we may examine the jade. If it is as stated, we will pay him the silver immediately.” Following orders, Jia Lian invited the man in and treated him as a guest, thanking him profusely: “If I may borrow this jade until I present it to our master—and I promise not to shortchange you in silver—please.” The man had no choice but to send over a package wrapped in red silk. When Jia Lian unwrapped it, was it not the same translucent, beautiful jade? Jia Lian, who had never been one to question such things, now took a keen look. After a long while, he could almost make out the inscriptions—words like “ward off evil” and so on. Delighted, Jia Lian called for the servants and hurried to present it to Jia Mu and Madam Wang. The whole family was stirred; everyone eagerly gathered to examine it. Fengjie, upon seeing Jia Lian come in, snatched it immediately, unwilling to let anyone else see it first, and delivered it to Jia Mu. Jia Lian laughed and said, “To think such a trivial matter would allow me to score a merit!” When Jia Mu unwrapped the jade, he noticed that it seemed considerably duller than before. He rubbed it with his hand, and Yuanyang put on her spectacles to inspect it. “Strange,” she said, “this jade indeed is something—but where has the brilliant luster vanished?” Madam Wang, after examining it for a while, could not recognize it either and called Fengjie over. Fengjie observed, “It does look familiar, though the color is somewhat off. Perhaps we should have Baoyu examine it himself—then all will be clear.” Xiren, who was watching from the side, also looked on, silently praying that it truly was the one, though she dared not voice any doubts. Thus, Fengjie took the jade from Jia Mu’s hands and, together with Xiren, brought it to Baoyu for his inspection. At that moment, Baoyu, who had just awakened from sleep, lazily accepted it without closely inspecting, and tossed it to the ground, saying, “Here you go—yet again, you are trying to fool me.” He merely gave a cold laugh. Fengjie quickly retrieved the jade and said, “Isn’t it strange? How can you know it without even looking?” Baoyu did not reply, only smiling. Madam Wang then entered the room and, upon seeing him like this, said, “There is nothing more to say. That jade was always one of those mysterious objects born with you—of a kind that makes sense only to you. It appears that this very piece must have been crafted by someone upon seeing the posted notice.” At that moment, everyone suddenly realized the truth. Outside in another room, Jia Lian overheard these remarks and said, “If that’s not so, then quickly bring it here so I may ask him about it. For one to behave in such a manner and then still have the nerve to fool around!” Jia Mu scolded him, “Lian’er, just take it to him and tell him to go on his way. He is, after all, a desperate man with nowhere else to turn. Seeing that our household has such circumstances, he thought he could make a little money by selling this off. In the end, he squandered his money on this thing and now expects us to recognize it. I say, let us not trouble him further—simply return the jade to him with a small reward of silver. Once word gets out and others know he did so, they won’t dare bring it in.” Jia Lian assented and went out. The man waited, and after a long while without anyone arriving, he grew uneasy—only to see Jia Lian storm out, clearly indignant. To be continued… Chapter 96 Concealing the News, Fengjie Hatches a Stratagem; Revealing the Plot, Pan'er’s True Nature Is Unmasked  It happened that Jia Lian, fuming in anger over that fake jade, stormed out to the study. The man who had delivered it, noticing Jia Lian’s ill humor, grew fearful and hastily rose to greet him. Before he could utter a word, Jia Lian sneered coldly, “How dare you!
Fengjie added a few more words, and Jia Mu finally smiled wryly, “It may work, but it will make poor Miss Bao suffer. If the ruckus breaks out, what then of Lin Guniang?” Fengjie answered, “This matter is to be told only to Baoyu—no one else shall hear a word.” At that moment a maid announced, “Second Master Lian has returned.” Madam Wang, fearing that Jia Mu might question him, exchanged a knowing glance with Fengjie. Fengjie went out to meet Jia Lian, pursing her lips as she joined Madam Wang in waiting. After a while, Madam Wang re-entered, her eyes red from weeping. Jia Lian offered his respects and then explained the situation at Shili Tun regarding the preparations for Prince Wang Teng’s funeral. He added, “I have received an imperial edict appointing our uncle to the Cabinet, with the title of Wenqin Duke; he has ordered that our family shall carry his casket back home, with palace officials escorting him along the way. Yesterday he departed, and the rest of the family has already returned south. Our maternal aunt sent word to inquire after us, saying ‘Who would have thought you could not enter the capital? There is so much unsaid—if my elder brother happens to meet you on the road, let him come and explain in detail.’” Hearing this, Madam Wang’s grief deepened. Fengjie consoled her, “Madam, please rest for a while; let us discuss Baoyu’s matter tonight.” After that, Fengjie returned with Jia Lian to her own room and discreetly told him to set aside any talk of the new bridal chamber. Later that day, after breakfast, Daiyu, accompanied by Zizhuan, went to see Jia Mu—both to pay her respects and to lift her spirits. As she left the Xiang Pavilion, she walked a few steps but suddenly recalled that she had forgotten her handkerchief. She sent Zizhuan back to fetch it while she ambled slowly, waiting. Just then, near Qinfang Bridge—by the very stone where Baoyu once lay flowers for the dead—she heard someone weeping softly. Daiyu paused and strained her ears but could not make out whose cry it was or what sorrowful words were being uttered. Curious, she approached slowly. There, she saw a maid with thick brows and large eyes weeping. At first, Daiyu suspected that one of the senior maids in the household might be venting her woes; but on closer look, she could not recognize the girl. The maid, noticing Daiyu’s approach, ceased her crying and wiped away her tears. Daiyu asked, “Why are you so heartbroken?” The maid, still crying, said, “Miss Lin, please judge the matter. When they speak, I don’t know what to say—I just uttered one wrong word, and my elder sister beat me!” Daiyu, not quite understanding, asked, “Who is your elder sister?” The maid replied, “It’s Sister Zhenzhu.” Only then did Daiyu realize that the maid belonged to Jia Mu’s household. She inquired further, “And what is your name?” The maid answered, “I’m called ‘Silly Big Sister.’” Daiyu smiled gently and asked, “And why did your sister beat you? What did you say?” The maid replied, “It was about Second Master Baoyu marrying Miss Bao.” At the sound of this, Daiyu was struck like a bolt of lightning; her heart pounded wildly. Gathering herself, she beckoned, “Come with me.” The maid followed Daiyu to the secluded spot by the peach-blossom tomb. There, behind a quiet outcrop, Daiyu asked, “Why did they beat you over Baoyu marrying Miss Bao?” “Silly Big Sister” explained, “Our old lady, Madam Wang, and Second Mistress discussed it. Since our old master is to leave soon, they decided to hurry off to negotiate with the second mistress to bring Miss Bao into the family. First, they intended it as a ‘good luck’ match for Second Master; then… ” At this point she smiled at Daiyu before continuing, “They even mentioned to Miss Lin about the bride’s family.” Daiyu was left dumbfounded.

First, they intended it as a ‘good luck’ match for Second Master; then… ” At this point she smiled at Daiyu before continuing, “They even mentioned to Miss Lin about the bride’s family.” Daiyu was left dumbfounded. The maid continued, “I don’t know exactly how they agreed—everyone was told not to speak out loud for fear that Miss Bao might overhear and get upset. I casually mentioned to Sister Xiren in Baoyu’s room, ‘Tomorrow will be even more lively—both Miss Bao and Second Mistress will be here! What shall we call it then?’ No sooner had I said that than my sister came over and struck me across the face, calling me a blabbermouth for not following orders, and threatened to drive me out. I understand why we are not allowed to speak freely—since you all did not tell me, she beat me.” Tears resumed as she sobbed. Daiyu’s heart was a tangle of sweetness and bitterness, as if sugar, salt, vinegar, and sourness were mixed together—she could not decide what flavor to name. After a while, her voice trembled as she said, “Stop prattling on. If you keep this up and someone hears you, you’ll be beaten again. Now go on your way.” Then, turning to leave, Daiyu found that her legs felt as though they bore a thousand pounds; though her feet seemed to tread on soft cotton, they had grown weak. Step by step, she trudged along slowly. After walking for a long while, she had not yet reached the banks of Qinfang Bridge. For her steps were feeble and her mind muddled, and she inadvertently wandered off the proper path, extending her journey by several more paces. At length, she arrived at the edge of Qinfang Bridge—but then, as if unconsciously drawn back along the embankment, she began to retrace her steps. Zizhuan, having fetched the handkerchief, looked about and did not see Daiyu. While searching, she spied a figure with a pallid, ashen face—Daiyu, staggering slightly, turning this way and that. Then, from a distance, another maid was seen moving ahead, though too far away to be clearly identified. Alarmed and uncertain, Zizhuan hurried over and softly asked, “Miss, where are you headed?
How regretful that I did not mention it sooner!’ I believe the Mistress clearly has plenty—why must we stir up more trouble?”  Feng Xifeng replied, “But there was no outsider that day—who let that news slip?”  Ping’er thought for a long while and then laughed, “That’s right. It wasn’t during conversation when no one was around—it was later, when someone came to deliver goods at night. Grandmother’s ‘Silly Big Sister’s’ mother happened to be delivering freshly pressed garments, and while she was sitting in the lower room she saw a large chest of items and naturally inquired about them. The maids must have let it slip, and then the rumor spread.”  Accordingly, Ping’er summoned several little maids and asked, “Who told Silly Big Sister’s mother that day?”  The little maids, alarmed, knelt and swore solemnly, “None of us dared say more than a word! Whenever anyone asks, we all reply we know nothing—how could we dare speak?”  Feng Xifeng then explained in detail, “They wouldn’t dare say another word and risk blame. Let’s set this matter aside for now and focus on sending the Mistress away—it is most urgent. Better that we have fewer matters to worry about than cause further embarrassment.” Then she ordered, “Ping’er, take my gold ornaments and pledge them for two hundred taels of silver to settle this matter.”  Jia Lian remarked, “Might as well pledge an extra two hundred—we must show our resolve.”  Feng Xifeng replied, “There’s no need—I have no use for it. I’m not even sure which item is to be redeemed.”  Ping’er took the order and instructed Wang’er’s wife to handle it. Soon enough the silver was procured, and Jia Lian personally delivered it—matter resolved, for now. At that moment, Feng Xifeng and Ping’er discussed those suspected of spreading rumors. “Could it be that even Yuanyang is involved?” they murmured. Suddenly, someone announced, “The Mistress has arrived!”  Feng Xifeng was startled and, uncertain of what was happening, quickly went out with Ping’er to greet her. Meanwhile, Wang Furen’s expression grew even sterner; she entered accompanied by a single maid and, without a word, went into the inner chambers. Feng Xifeng quickly offered her tea and, forcing a smile, asked, “Madam, are you well today? Have you come for a stroll?”  Wang Furen curtly commanded, “Ping’er, go out!”  Startled, Ping’er immediately replied and led several young maids outside, standing by the door as it was securely closed. Then she herself sat on the steps, ensuring that no one could re-enter. Observing all this, Feng Xifeng grew anxious and asked, “Madam, what is the matter?”  Wang Furen, tears in her eyes, retrieved a perfumed sachet from her sleeve and threw it out, exclaiming, “Look here!”  Feng Xifeng quickly picked it up—it was a richly embroidered, multi‑colored “Spring Joy” sachet. Shocked, she asked, “Madam, where did you get this?”  Wang Furen, trembling and weeping, replied, “Where did I get it? I was sitting by the well—and I thought you were as attentive as I am! But it appears that in broad daylight this very item was found by one of Grandmother’s maids on a rock in the garden. Before long it would have been delivered to Grandmother. Tell me, how did it come to be here?”  Feng Xifeng, now even more agitated, asked, “Madam, how can you be sure it is mine?”  Wang Furen, still crying and lamenting, said, “How can I tell? Which other woman in our household would dare possess such an item? It is said that if a young lady is seen with it, even the servants would notice. If any maid were to find it and spread the word, our reputation would be ruined!”  Deeply embarrassed, Feng Xifeng knelt at the steps and, through tears, confessed, “Madam, I never meant for this to happen.
Behind an empty room hung a seven-star lamp, beneath which several straw figures stood—some with headbands, some with nails on their chests, and some with chains around their necks. In a cabinet, countless paper effigies were stored. Small ledgers recorded that a certain household was inspected and fined a certain amount of silver; expenses for oil and incense were incalculable.”  Fengjie said, “It seems our troubles indeed stem from him. I recall that after we fell ill, that old fiend came several times to Aunt Zhao’s, begging for silver, and when he saw me his face changed and his eyes resembled those of a frightened bird. I had guessed the reason then, but now it appears there was indeed cause. Yet as long as I am in charge here, there will naturally be grievances—no wonder people are angry with me. Bao Yu has no enemies; how can I endure such harsh treatment? It is unbearable!”  Grandmother Jia said, “Who knows—perhaps it is because I care so deeply for Bao Yu and Huan’er that I have inadvertently caused you troubles?” Madame Wang replied, “What can one do when faced with an ignorant person? When our elders are not properly informed, the details cannot be acknowledged; if the matter becomes public, it would bring disgrace. Let him suffer his fate—eventually, he will expose himself.” Grandmother Jia said, “You speak truly. Without proper evidence, nothing can be decided. But listen—our very own afflicted ones are worse off than most. Never mind what happened in the past, Fengjie, you need not mention it further. Today, after you and your madame have had dinner with me, you may go.”  Then Grandmother Jia ordered Yuanyang, Hupo, and others to serve the meal. Fengjie quickly laughed, “Why is it that the old matriarch is suddenly so concerned?” Madame Wang also laughed. At that moment, several wife-servants arrived. Fengjie quickly told the little maidservants, “I, along with my madame, will eat with Grandmother after dinner.” Just then, Yuchuan came and told Madame Wang, “The old master is seeking something—please attend once Grandmother’s meal is finished; go and find it.” Grandmother Jia said, “You go ahead; do not worry about the old master’s urgent matters.” Madame Wang agreed, leaving Fengjie to attend, and then returned to her own room. In her room, Madame Wang chatted with Jia Zheng about trivial matters and had the items searched for. Jia Zheng then asked, “Has Ying’er returned? How is she faring at the Sun family?” Madame Wang replied, “Young Ying has been weeping bitterly, saying that Uncle Sun is terribly fierce.” She then recounted Ying’er’s story. Jia Zheng sighed, “I knew it was not right, but Grandfather has already decided that there is nothing I can do. Ying’er must endure some grievances.” Madame Wang said, “But she is a new bride; we only hope that she will eventually thrive.” Laughing, Jia Zheng said, “What are you laughing about?” Madame Wang recounted Bao Yu’s words humorously. Jia Zheng couldn’t help but laugh and then said, “Speaking of Bao Yu, I recall something. This child, kept roaming the garden, is not doing well. If a daughter is unproductive, it is trivial; but if she is productive, it matters greatly. Recently, someone mentioned a certain gentleman from the south—a man of learning and exemplary character. I think that gentleman is very gentle. Our city children, though clever, are impetuous; if such a gentleman continues to act foolishly, it would be a waste. That is why our elders have refused to hire an external teacher, preferring instead to choose someone from within the family with some experience to teach the children. Now, although our venerable master’s scholarship is only average, he still manages to keep these young ones in check, so that they do not waste their lives.” Jia Zheng said, “Indeed; for now we only require that Bao Yu study—recite, compose essays. If he refuses to learn, then let our master discipline him so that he is not all talk and no substance, squandering his life.” After speaking, he stood, bowed, exchanged a few trivial words, and then took his leave.
Xiren and Madam Wang, once secluded in the inner room, fell to their knees and burst into tears. Not understanding at first, Madam Wang gently took Xiren’s hand and said, “What is this? Speak now—what grievance have you?” Xiren choked, “I shouldn’t speak, but I’m at my wit’s end!” “Speak slowly,” urged Madam Wang. Xiren confided, “The old lady and Madam have decided on a match for Miss Bao—it would be a fine matter. But I wonder, in your eyes, is it better for Baoyu to wed Miss Bao or Lin Guniang?” Madam Wang replied, “They grew up together, so perhaps Baoyu and Lin Guniang have a closer bond.” Xiren insisted, “It isn’t ‘closer’ enough.” She went on to recount, in detail, the various incidents involving Baoyu and Daiyu over the years—matters which, Madam Wang herself had witnessed, though Xiren had never dared speak of them. Taking Xiren’s words to heart, Madam Wang whispered, “It appears the rumors are gaining ground. And if you listen to what the old master said, look at his expression!” Xiren said, “Nowadays, whenever someone speaks to Baoyu he smiles; if no one speaks, he sleeps—so he hasn’t really heard a word of what’s been said.” Madam Wang sighed, “What are we to do about this?” Xiren replied, “I have spoken, but now it falls to you to tell the old lady and devise a foolproof plan.” Madam Wang then said, “Very well—do as you must. For now, let no one else mention this matter. As for the second mistress’s side, I fear they will not agree. If they do consent, we must proceed according to the old lady’s wishes.” She added, “The second mistress’s side is under my protection—you go, then.” Jia Zheng, after hearing all this, was at a loss. For his assignment left him uneasy, and though the household was abuzz with preparations for the wedding, the news of Baoyu’s condition remained a heavy burden. Soon, Baoyu met with Jia Zheng and was taken by Xiren back to his room. With Jia Zheng away, no one dared speak to him directly; thus, he drifted into a daze and fell into a fitful sleep, oblivious to all that had been said. Yet Xiren and the others quietly grasped every detail. Though some stray whispers had reached them, the absence of Baochai’s presence lent credence to the truth. That day, as they absorbed these developments, Xiren’s heart vacillated between joy and sorrow. She mused, “Truly, the higher-ups have seen clearly—our fate is in their hands! If he complies, many of my burdens will be lifted. But this man’s heart is solely fixed on Lin Guniang. Thank goodness he did not hear; if he did, who knows what turmoil might erupt!” Xiren’s thoughts, once joyful, turned bitter, and she whispered to herself, “What are we to do? How can the old lady and Madam possibly know our inner thoughts? If they learn of our private schemes… Initially, I thought that if he recovered, he might be cured of his follies. But if he were to hear that his marriage is to Miss Bao while his heart still yearns for Lin Guniang, it would not only fail to bring him luck but might even prove fatal! If I don’t clarify things now, we’ll bring harm upon three people!” Resolving her mind, Xiren waited until Jia Zheng had departed. Then, having instructed Qiu Wen to watch Baoyu, she slipped out and approached Madam Wang, urging her quietly to retire with her to the room behind Jia Mu’s quarters so they might speak in private. Just then, Jia Mu was discussing wedding plans with Fengjie when Madam Wang entered. “What is it, Xiren? Why are you skulking about?” asked Jia Mu. Taking the opportunity, Madam Wang recounted to Jia Mu everything she had heard about Baoyu’s troubled state. For a long while, Jia Mu said nothing; both Madam Wang and Fengjie fell silent. Finally, Jia Mu sighed, “All matters can be discussed—but Lin Guniang, at least, poses no threat.
At this point, Madam Xue, who had always had access to Madame Wang, asked her to intercede with Jia Zheng. After Jia Zheng inquired about the details, he could only offer vague responses, saying that they would wait until Xue Ke submitted his memorial and see how the county authorities would rule before proceeding further. Meanwhile, Madam Xue had already exchanged silver at the pawnshop and sent the junior servant off with it. Three days later, a reply finally arrived. Madam Xue immediately called a young maid to fetch Baochai so they could read the letter together. The letter read as follows:  “The silver has been used to cover the official fees at the county office. My brother, though in custody, is not suffering greatly—please do reassure the mistress. However, the officials here are very exacting; even the close relatives acting as witnesses refuse to cooperate, and even the friend our brother called upon is assisting them. Since Li Xiang and I are native-born, we were fortunate to find a gentleman who, for a sum of silver, has offered us a plan. He suggests that if we can coerce Wu Liang—who was drinking with our brother that very night—to testify, and offer him some silver to ‘tear up’ the confession, then if he refuses, we can blame the death on a certain Zhang San, an outsider. If Wu Liang cannot stomach it, then all will be settled. I followed his advice, and sure enough, Wu Liang came forward. Now, a witness has been arranged and another memorial has been drafted; it was submitted the day before yesterday and approved today. Please see the memorial for details.” And the memorial continued with these words: “I, the undersigned, hereby present this petition concerning my brother’s tragic misfortune and the redress of his grievance: My dear blood-brother, Xue Pan, originally from Nanjing but residing in the Western Capital, departed on business down south on [a certain date]. Not long after, a family servant delivered a letter saying that he had been ‘killed’—and he immediately rushed to the authorities. Upon arrival in prison, our brother tearfully confessed that he had accidentally injured a man surnamed Zhang. In the ensuing interrogations, he insisted that he had never harbored any enmity against Zhang; indeed, the two had no prior grudge. It happened by chance at a wine-drinking quarrel when, as our brother flung down his wine, Zhang San happened to be bending over to pick something up; in that moment, the wine bowl accidentally struck his head, causing his death. Fearing punishment, our brother, under duress, admitted that a fight had broken out. In his plea for mercy, he has cited the Emperor’s benevolence; however, no verdict has yet been reached. With our brother still in confinement, I now submit this statement on his behalf, risking life and limb. I humbly beg for the Emperor’s gracious favor in allowing a formal re-examination of the evidence. Our entire family shall remain forever in your debt.” The ruling read: “The post-mortem examination of the corpse has confirmed the evidence beyond doubt. Moreover, no torture was administered, and your brother himself confessed to the fight leading to death. Since you are far removed from the incident and did not witness it, you cannot be expected to fabricate evidence. According to the law, he should be convicted. However, taking into account your brother’s plight, we shall be lenient. Case closed—petition denied.” Upon hearing these words, Madam Xue exclaimed, “Isn’t this hopeless? How can this be acceptable?” Baochai interjected, “You haven’t finished reading the rest of Second Brother’s letter yet; there’s more.” Then she recited further: “The matter hinges on one crucial question; further inquiries will reveal everything.” Madam Xue then questioned the messenger, “So what is it they want?” He replied, “The county has known for some time that our family’s assets are ample. They require us to secure an influential position in the capital and present an even larger gift, so that the case may be reexamined and our brother’s sentence lightened. The mistress must act quickly—any further delay might result in our eldest uncle suffering unduly.” Hearing this, Madam Xue sent the junior servant off once more to explain the situation to the Jia household by way of Madame Wang, earnestly pleading with Jia Zheng. Jia Zheng would only agree to have his acquaintances intercede with the county magistrate, and he refused to mention any money. Fearing that this would prove ineffective, Madam Xue sought help from Sister Feng and Jia Lian, spending several thousand silver taels to bribe the county magistrate.
Jia Zheng quickly poured another cup for Grandmother Jia. Grandmother Jia said, “Since that is so, quickly have someone fetch some strong liquor so that those married men among you will not be troubled.” Everyone laughed again. Only Jia Lian and Bao Yu dared not laugh too heartily. Then the drum was struck again, starting with Jia Zheng and, by chance, stopping with Bao Yu. Bao Yu, uneasy with Jia Zheng’s presence at his side, thought, “If I tell a joke, what if it isn’t good? And if I do say one well, then it won’t be taken lightly—after all, I’m only known for my rambling; that would only add to my troubles. Better not speak at all.” So he rose and excused himself, saying, “I cannot speak; please allow someone else to take the turn.” Jia Zheng said, “Since that is so, let’s limit it to one ‘autumn’ character; compose a poem inspired by the scene. If it is good, you shall be rewarded; if not, we shall deliberate tomorrow!” Grandmother Jia quickly exclaimed, “What a fine order—why must you compose a poem now?” Jia Zheng smiled and said, “He is capable.” Grandmother Jia said, “Then do so—quickly, have someone fetch paper and pen.” Jia Zheng said, “But do not use those decorative phrases like ‘water,’ ‘crystal,’ ‘ice,’ ‘jade,’ ‘silver,’ ‘color,’ ‘bright,’ ‘pure,’ etc. I want something original, reflecting the sentiments of these past years.” Bao Yu, hearing this, felt it deeply in his heart and immediately composed four lines on paper, which he then presented to Jia Zheng. Jia Zheng read them and nodded silently. Seeing this, Grandmother Jia, satisfied that nothing was amiss, asked, “How is it?” Jia Zheng, eager to please Grandmother Jia, said, “It is troublesome for him. He refuses to read, and in the end his words lack refinement.” Grandmother Jia said, “That’s fine. He should be rewarded so that he will work even harder in the future.” Jia Zheng agreed, “Exactly.” Then he turned and ordered an old nursemaid to go out, “Tell the footmen to fetch the fans I brought from Hainan—two for Bao Yu.” Bao Yu bowed deeply, then returned to his seat to resume the game. At that moment, Jia Lan, seeing that Bao Yu had been rewarded, also took his turn to compose a poem and present it to Jia Zheng. Jia Zheng read it and was even more delighted, then shared it with Grandmother Jia, who was very pleased, and promptly ordered Jia Zheng to bestow rewards upon him. After this, everyone resumed their seats and the game continued. This time, Jia She remained silent, drinking and telling jokes. He said, “In a family, the most filial son is the one whose mother falls ill. When all attempts at finding a doctor fail, one may invite a certain acupuncture woman. This woman, who knew nothing of the pulse, merely claimed it was due to an overactive heart-fire and that one needle would cure it. The son, in panic, asked, ‘If the heart is as hard as iron, how can a needle cure it?’ The woman replied, ‘There is no need to needle the heart—just needle the rib cartilage.’ The son said, ‘But the rib cartilage is far from the heart—how would that work?’ The woman replied, ‘It matters not. You see, among all parents in the world, many are partial to one child!’” Everyone laughed upon hearing this, and even Grandmother Jia could only sip half a cup of wine before laughing and saying, “I, too, need that woman’s acupuncture.” Hearing this, Jia She, knowing he had spoken too roughly, quickly rose, toasted Grandmother Jia with his cup, and offered a brief explanation. Grandmother Jia did not wish to dwell on the subject and resumed the game. Unexpectedly, the turn fell to Jia Huan. Lately, Jia Huan had made some progress in his studies and taken an interest in worldly affairs. Now, upon seeing Bao Yu compose a poem and be rewarded, he felt a creative itch and, though reluctant to act rashly in front of Jia Zheng, he managed to seize a pen and paper, composing a couplet on the spot and presenting it to Jia Zheng.
But if he were to hear that his marriage is to Miss Bao while his heart still yearns for Lin Guniang, it would not only fail to bring him luck but might even prove fatal! If I don’t clarify things now, we’ll bring harm upon three people!” Resolving her mind, Xiren waited until Jia Zheng had departed. Then, having instructed Qiu Wen to watch Baoyu, she slipped out and approached Madam Wang, urging her quietly to retire with her to the room behind Jia Mu’s quarters so they might speak in private. Just then, Jia Mu was discussing wedding plans with Fengjie when Madam Wang entered. “What is it, Xiren? Why are you skulking about?” asked Jia Mu. Taking the opportunity, Madam Wang recounted to Jia Mu everything she had heard about Baoyu’s troubled state. For a long while, Jia Mu said nothing; both Madam Wang and Fengjie fell silent. Finally, Jia Mu sighed, “All matters can be discussed—but Lin Guniang, at least, poses no threat. If Baoyu is truly as he is, we are in deep trouble.” Fengjie, after a moment’s thought, said, “It won’t be as bad as it seems. I have devised a plan—if our scheme does not work, then it will not matter. But if he shows any signs of interest, we’ll have to take extensive measures.” Madam Wang asked, “And what is this ‘switching’ plan you mention?” Fengjie replied, “Whether or not Baoyu understands our intentions, if everyone starts clamoring that the old master has decreed Lin Guniang as his bride, we can observe his reaction. If he pays no heed, then no switch is needed. But if he shows some affection, we’ll have to cover it up.” Madam Wang pressed, “Even if he does fancy her, what can you do?” Leaning close to Madam Wang, Fengjie whispered her scheme in detail. Madam Wang nodded and smiled, “Very well then.” Jia Mu inquired, “So what exactly have you two schemed?” Fengjie, fearing that Jia Mu might not understand, revealed the details in a low voice. Jia Mu, however, remained momentarily confused. Fengjie added a few more words, and Jia Mu finally smiled wryly, “It may work, but it will make poor Miss Bao suffer. If the ruckus breaks out, what then of Lin Guniang?” Fengjie answered, “This matter is to be told only to Baoyu—no one else shall hear a word.” At that moment a maid announced, “Second Master Lian has returned.” Madam Wang, fearing that Jia Mu might question him, exchanged a knowing glance with Fengjie. Fengjie went out to meet Jia Lian, pursing her lips as she joined Madam Wang in waiting. After a while, Madam Wang re-entered, her eyes red from weeping. Jia Lian offered his respects and then explained the situation at Shili Tun regarding the preparations for Prince Wang Teng’s funeral. He added, “I have received an imperial edict appointing our uncle to the Cabinet, with the title of Wenqin Duke; he has ordered that our family shall carry his casket back home, with palace officials escorting him along the way. Yesterday he departed, and the rest of the family has already returned south. Our maternal aunt sent word to inquire after us, saying ‘Who would have thought you could not enter the capital? There is so much unsaid—if my elder brother happens to meet you on the road, let him come and explain in detail.’” Hearing this, Madam Wang’s grief deepened. Fengjie consoled her, “Madam, please rest for a while; let us discuss Baoyu’s matter tonight.” After that, Fengjie returned with Jia Lian to her own room and discreetly told him to set aside any talk of the new bridal chamber. Later that day, after breakfast, Daiyu, accompanied by Zizhuan, went to see Jia Mu—both to pay her respects and to lift her spirits. As she left the Xiang Pavilion, she walked a few steps but suddenly recalled that she had forgotten her handkerchief. She sent Zizhuan back to fetch it while she ambled slowly, waiting.
Jia Zheng took the cup, placed it before Grandmother Jia, and she drank a sip. Jia She and Jia Zheng then returned to their places. Then Jia Zheng said, “This man who is afraid of his wife never dares to take another step. Yet on that day – the fifteenth of August – when he went out to buy things, he encountered a few friends who insisted on dragging him home for a drink. After getting drunk, he slept at a friend’s house. The next day, upon waking and regretting it, he had no choice but to come home and make amends. His wife was washing her feet and said, ‘Since it is so, you must lick them for me, and then I’ll let you off.’ The man had no choice but to lick them, and couldn’t help but feel disgusted and nearly vomit. His wife then became angry and threatened to beat him, saying, ‘How dare you be so frivolous!’ The poor fellow immediately knelt and begged, ‘It wasn’t my dear mother’s foot that was pickled, it’s only that I drank too much huangjiu yesterday and ate mooncake filling, so I feel sour today.’” This account had Grandmother Jia and everyone laughing. Jia Zheng quickly poured another cup for Grandmother Jia. Grandmother Jia said, “Since that is so, quickly send someone to fetch some strong wine, so that those married men among you won’t be troubled.” Everyone laughed again. Only Jia Lian and Bao Yu dared not laugh heartily. Then the drum was struck again, starting with Jia Zheng, and by chance it stopped at Bao Yu. Bao Yu, uneasy with Jia Zheng’s presence and in his hand, thought, “If I tell a joke, what if it’s not good? And if I say one that is good, then it won’t be taken seriously – I’m only known for being a chatterbox, and that would only add to my troubles. Better not say anything.” So he rose and excused himself, “I cannot speak; please allow someone else.” Jia Zheng said, “Since that is so, let’s limit it to one ‘autumn’ character; write a poem inspired by the scene. If it is good, you shall be rewarded; if not, we will deliberate tomorrow!” Grandmother Jia quickly said, “What a fine order – why must you make a poem now?” Jia Zheng replied with a smile, “He is capable.” Grandmother Jia said, “Then go on.” “Quickly fetch paper and pen.” Jia Zheng said, “But do not use those decorative words like ‘water,’ ‘crystal,’ ‘ice,’ ‘jade,’ ‘silver,’ ‘color,’ ‘bright,’ ‘pure’ and so on. I want you to come up with something original – try out the feelings of these past few years.” Bao Yu, hearing this, felt it deeply in his heart and immediately composed four lines on paper, presenting them to Jia Zheng. Jia Zheng looked at them and nodded silently. Seeing this, Grandmother Jia, pleased that nothing was amiss, asked, “How is it?” Jia Zheng, wanting Grandmother to be pleased, said, “It is troublesome for him. He refuses to read books, and in the end, his verses are not elegant.” Grandmother Jia said, “That’s enough. He should be rewarded, and let him work even harder in the future.” Jia Zheng agreed, “Exactly.” Then he turned to order an old nursemaid to go out, “Instruct the footmen to fetch the fans I brought from Hainan – two for Bao Yu.” Bao Yu kowtowed and then returned to his seat to continue the order. At that moment, Jia Lan, seeing that Bao Yu had been rewarded, also took the opportunity to compose a poem and present it to Jia Zheng. Jia Zheng read it and was even more delighted. He then shared it with Grandmother Jia, who was very pleased, and quickly ordered Jia Zheng to award him. Then everyone resumed their seats, and the game continued. This time, Jia She sat holding his cup in his hand, merely drinking and telling jokes. He said, “In a family, the most filial son is the one whose mother falls ill.
The maid hastily asked, “What is the official matter?” The little maid replied, “I don’t know exactly. Just now a junior servant at the Second Gate reported that Master has urgent official business, so the Mistress ordered that Second Master be summoned.” Upon hearing news concerning the Ministry of Works, Fengjie’s heart eased a little. She said, “Go back and tell the Mistress that Second Master did not return last night because he had affairs outside the city—send word that he was dispatched to see Brother Zhen first.” The maid agreed and hurried off. Soon after, Jia Zhen arrived with men from the ministry. He inquired about the matter, and upon learning the details, returned to report to Madam Wang. He announced, “The Ministry has sent word that yesterday the Grand Canal was reported in full to the Emperor—along the Henan region, a river mouth was decisively closed off, submerging several prefectures and counties. There will be a national expenditure soon to repair the city walls and other public works. The officials in the Ministry are making all sorts of arrangements. They will report further details to the Master soon.” With that, he departed. Not long after, Jia Zheng returned home. From that day on until winter, Jia Zheng was so occupied with official duties that he was constantly in the yamen. Baoyu’s academic lessons relaxed a bit, but ever fearful that Jia Zheng might notice, he dared not stray from the study room—not even visiting Daiyu often. It was now mid-October. One chilly morning, Baoyu rose and set off for his study. The weather was suddenly cold; Xiren had long since prepared a package of garments. She said to Baoyu, “Today the weather is very cool—it would be better for you to have something warm on both morning and evening.” With that, she produced some clothes, selecting one for him. She also prepared another set and had a little maid fetch it for Bei Ming, instructing, “Since it is cold, Second Master, be sure to change when needed.” Bei Ming agreed, clutching his felt package as he accompanied Baoyu. When Baoyu reached the study, he began his lessons. Suddenly, a harsh wind rattled against the paper window. The substitute teacher remarked, “The weather has shifted again.” He pushed open the wind-shutter, and they saw on the northwest a mass of dark clouds steadily rolling toward the southeast. Soon, Bei Ming returned to Baoyu, saying, “Second Master, it’s cold—fetch more clothes.” Baoyu nodded. Bei Ming then brought in a garment. Baoyu, at first not looking at it, soon examined it with rapt attention; all the small students crowded to gawk. It turned out to be that “sparrow-gold” jacket that Qingwen had mended. Baoyu asked, “Who gave you this?” Bei Ming replied, “It was prepared by the maidservants inside.” Baoyu said, “I’m not very cold; I’d rather keep it wrapped up.” The substitute teacher assumed that Baoyu cherished frugality, and though Bei Ming urged, “Second Master, wear it. If you catch a cold, it will be my fault; please consider my care,” Baoyu, with little alternative, donned it and sat staring at his books. The teacher took it for granted that Baoyu was absorbed in his studies, and said little more. That evening, when lessons ended, Baoyu went to ask the teacher for a day’s leave on account of illness. The elderly substitute, who was himself prone to various aches and pains and often enjoyed the company of the children, happily granted his request—knowing full well that Jia Zheng was busy and that Grandmother’s indulgence prevailed. Baoyu returned home, paid his respects to Grandmother and Madam Wang, and after a brief conversation, went back to the garden. There, he met Xiren and others, but unlike his usual cheerful self, he seemed sullen; he lay on the kang (heated platform) in his clothes. Xiren said, “Dinner is ready. Would you like to eat now or wait a bit?” Baoyu replied, “I’m not hungry—I feel unwell. You all eat without me.” Xiren then added, “In that case, you should change out of that garment. How can that thing stand all this wear and tear?” Baoyu answered, “No need to change it.” Xiren pressed, “Not only is it a delicate thing, but look at the stitches on it—they shouldn’t be subjected to such abuse.” Baoyu sighed deeply, as those words struck his heart.
The prince spoke some more kind words, and suddenly laughed, saying, “The last time I saw your piece of jade, I found it rather interesting. Later, I asked for its pattern to be replicated, and they made another one. Today, since you have come, I’ll let you take it home to play with.” He then ordered a junior eunuch to fetch it and personally handed it over to Baoyu. Baoyu accepted it with both hands, thanked him, and then withdrew. The prince then sent two junior eunuchs after him, and he returned together with Jia She and the others. After meeting with Grandmother Jia, Jia She and the others each departed. Meanwhile, Jia Zheng, accompanied by the three, had already offered his respects to Grandmother Jia and mentioned whom they had encountered in the mansion. Baoyu also recounted what Inspector Wu had said in support of his late father during the inspection. Jia Zheng remarked, “Inspector Wu has always been a friend to us—one of our own—and indeed he is a man of principle.” After exchanging a few more casual remarks, Grandmother Jia said, “You all should take a rest.” Jia Zheng then withdrew, with Zhen, Lian, and Baoyu following him to the door. Jia Zheng said, “You all go back and keep our matriarch company.” With that, he returned to his room. Shortly after, a little maid came back and announced, “Lin Zhixiao has come outside to send a message for you, sir.” She then handed over a red slip bearing Inspector Wu’s name. Realizing someone had come to pay respects, Jia Zheng called for the maid to summon Lin Zhixiao. Jia Zheng went out into the corridor. Lin Zhixiao entered and inquired, “Today Inspector Wu came to pay his respects; I already sent him away. I also heard that the Ministry of Works has announced a vacancy for a Langzhong (a junior physician) position, and both outsiders and officials are saying that His Lordship intends to appoint someone.” Jia Zheng said, “Well, just look at that.” Lin Zhixiao said a few more words and then departed. Meanwhile, Zhen, Lian, and Baoyu returned, while only Baoyu lingered near Grandmother Jia’s side. He recounted how kindly the Prince of Bejing had treated him, and even produced the piece of jade. Everyone looked at it and laughed for a moment. Grandmother Jia then ordered, “Put it away for him, so that it isn’t lost.” She then asked, “Do take good care of that jade, don’t let it get mixed up with other things.” Baoyu then took it off his neck and said, “Isn’t this my piece of jade? It nearly fell off. In comparison, the other piece is far superior; it simply cannot be matched! I was just about to tell the old lady: the other night, when I was sleeping, I took it down from my neck and hung it by the curtain—and it suddenly shone so brightly that the whole tent was bathed in a red glow.” Grandmother Jia replied, “Nonsense. The eaves of the curtain are red, and with the firelight, naturally there is a red glow.” Baoyu said, “No, at that time the lights were out and the room was pitch dark—yet I could still see it.” Both Second Madame Xing and Madame Wang pursed their lips in amusement. Sister Feng said, “It must be that good news spreading.” Baoyu asked, “What good news?” Grandmother Jia said, “You wouldn’t understand. You’ve been babbling all day—now go and rest a bit, and don’t spout nonsense here.” Baoyu stood there a while longer before finally returning to the garden. At this point, Grandmother Jia asked, “By the way, did you all go to see the Concubine and mention this matter?” Madame Wang replied, “We were planning to, but Sister Feng’s little maid was delayed by Qiao Jie’er’s illness, so we only went today. We mentioned the matter to her, and her aunt was quite willing—she only said that Pan’er is not home at this time, and since her father is gone, they must discuss and decide together later.” Grandmother Jia said, “That makes sense.
Later, when Xue Ke was seen blowing out his lamp and falling asleep, Baocan returned to report to Jin Gui, who then planned his next move. Jin Gui, having not slept well all night, was at a loss for what to do; he resolved to wait until the next morning. At dawn, he planned to retrieve his belongings and, while changing into one or two sets of delicately colored garments without washing his hair—thus displaying a languid, coquettish air—he would feign anger and simply ignore Xue Ke. His idea was that if Xue Ke showed any sign of remorse, he would naturally withdraw, leaving Jin Gui’s plan intact. When, in the morning, Jin Gui encountered Xue Ke, who still appeared as he had the previous night with no sign of debauchery, Jin Gui deliberately returned with a dish, leaving behind the wine jug as a pretext for further intrigue. At that moment, Jin Gui asked, “Did you go with your things? Did anyone see you?” Baocan replied, “No.” Jin Gui pressed further, “And did Second Master ask you anything?” Baocan replied, “Not at all.” Jin Gui, having not slept through the night and at a loss for strategy, mused, “If I were to carry out such a scheme, others might be fooled—but how can Baocan keep it secret? Perhaps I should offer him a share so that he will have nothing to complain about. Besides, I cannot act on my own; I must rely on him to execute the plan. Let us agree on a secure course of action.” With a wry smile, Jin Gui continued, “Tell me, what sort of man is Second Master Xue Ke, really?” Baocan shrugged and said, “He appears rather foolish.” Jin Gui laughed, “You’re starting to act as if you’ve had your share of men! No wonder our elder brother could not do without you at home.” Baocan merely sneered and replied, “It is his failure to heed our Mistress’s wishes that I speak of.” Jin Gui demanded, “How has he failed my heart?” Baocan replied, “Our Mistress offers him the best food, yet he refuses to partake. Is that not a betrayal of her goodwill?” He winked conspiratorially at Jin Gui. Jin Gui scolded, “Don’t let your tongue run wild. I don’t understand your meaning.” Baocan laughed, “Don’t worry, Mistress, I have but one heart—no more to give. But these matters must be kept secret; if word gets out, it will all be for naught.” Jin Gui’s face flushed as he replied, “You, you little runt—you’re no good! It seems you’ve been busy seducing men, don’t you?” Baocan retorted, “I only act as our Mistress’s agent. As for our elder brother’s affairs, you know well what they are.” Thereafter, Jin Gui’s efforts to curry favor with Xue Ke became singularly focused on winning him over to his side. For a while, Xue Ke appeared indifferent; however, later, when Xue Ke extinguished his lamp and fell asleep, Jin Gui took that opportunity to return to Jin Gui and report to him, planning his next scheme. From that point on, Jin Gui maintained a polite façade while leaving behind only the wine jug as a signal for future rendezvous. In the meantime, Baochai’s mother and daughter noticed that Jin Gui (or, as others called him, the “golden” one) had grown unusually quiet and even affectionate in recent days—a stark contrast to his previous behavior. At home, even Madam Xue was overjoyed, thinking, “Surely this must be because when Xue Pan married, he transgressed in some way, and these past few years have been ruined. Now that such matters have come to light, thanks to our wealth and the Jia family’s influence, there is hope. Perhaps his temper will change, or perhaps Xue Pan’s fortune will turn.” This thought filled her with a rare joy. One afternoon after dinner, Madam Xue, accompanied by Tonggui, went to visit Jin Gui’s residence. Upon arriving in the courtyard, they heard a man speaking with Jin Gui. Tonggui, ever perceptive, said, “Aunt, the Mistress has arrived.” When they reached the door, a shadow slipped away behind the room.
If I must be mistaken again, so be it.” Madam Wang, while answering, hurried Yuanyang and others to open the chest of garments and adornments so that the old lady might dress quickly. After hastily preparing her own attire, Madam Wang went to serve in the palace. In short, the procession left without further mention. Meanwhile, after Yuan Chun was selected to reside in the Fengzao Palace, she enjoyed the imperial favor and, with her health robust, nonetheless found her movements laborious. Daily she was worn out by the rigors of court life, and periodically suffered from phlegm troubles. After returning from a banquet in the palace the previous day, she had caught a chill that reawakened an old ailment. Alas, this time it turned grave: her phlegm became so obstructed that her limbs grew cold. Despite immediate memorials and summons for the royal physicians, neither the prescribed medicines nor even the potent ‘tongguan’ remedies had any effect. The palace officials, in their anxiety, petitioned that preparations be made for her final rites. An imperial edict was issued, summoning the Jia family from the Pepper Chamber for an audience. Jia Mu and Madam Wang, following the order, entered the palace and saw that Yuan Consort, with phlegm clogging her throat and drooling, could not speak. On seeing Jia Mu, she only managed a sorrowful, weeping look—but without tears. Jia Mu stepped forward to pay his respects, offering words of consolation. In a short while, as Jia Zheng and other officials advanced, and the palace consorts delivered their memorials, Yuan Consort’s gaze gradually dulled, and her complexion changed. The inner palace eunuchs were about to report, fearing that if more consorts were sent to see her, the in-laws from the Pepper Chamber might be detained too long. Jia Mu and Madam Wang were heartbroken at the thought of parting, but bound by state protocol, they had to leave—though neither dared to cry aloud, their hearts ached deeply. Within the morning court, an official messenger arrived. Soon after, a eunuch came out with an imperial notice from the Celestial Bureau. Jia Mu’s heart sank; he dared not move. A short while later, a junior eunuch announced, “Madam Jia has passed away.” It was the 18th day of the 12th month of the Jia Yin year, the day of Lichun. Yuan Consort died on the 19th day of the 12th month, entering into the month of Mao in the Yinzhi year, at the age of forty-three. With a heavy heart, Jia Mu rose and was carried on a sedan chair back home. Jia Zheng and the others, having received the news, wept bitterly all the way. At home, Lady Xing, Li Wan, Fengjie, Baoyu, and the others gathered in the hall to welcome Jia Mu and to pay their respects to him, while Jia Zheng and Madam Wang did likewise—and all wept without cease. The next morning, all those of rank were required, in accordance with the rites for a noble consort, to enter the palace to pay their condolences. Jia Zheng, being a minister of the Ministry of Works, had to attend to ceremonial details and converse with colleagues; thus his schedule was even busier than it had been at the funerals of the former empress dowager and Consort Zhou. But as for Yuan Consort, no elaborate rites were held—she was posthumously titled the Virtuous and Gracious Consort. This was in keeping with the customs of the Wang family, and no further elaboration was needed. Meanwhile, in the Jia household, men and women were daily hurrying off to the palace. Fortunately, Fengjie’s health had improved in recent days and she even ventured out to oversee household affairs, while preparing for Prince Wang’s upcoming entry into the capital and the celebratory receptions. Fengjie’s brother, Wang Ren, upon hearing that our uncle had been admitted to the Cabinet, still came to the capital with his family. Fengjie, pleased to have members of her maternal family around, felt relieved—and her health seemed better. Madam Wang, seeing Fengjie managing matters as usual, felt her burdens lighten. With her brothers in the capital, all was at ease. Only Baoyu, a man without an official post and indifferent to studying, found himself neglected. Even the scholars of the Academy, aware of the family troubles, did not trouble themselves with him; and Jia Zheng, being so busy, naturally had no time to check on him.
If word gets out, won’t it be a laughingstock? If my elder brother and sister-in-law despise her and leave her to me, I’m doomed!” Aunt Xue replied, “Better to dismiss her entirely than let her remain with us.” Miss Bao laughed, “Whether she stays with me or not makes no difference—cut her off as if she were sold.” Xiangling had already run up to Aunt Xue, pleading bitterly and crying, unwilling to leave; she wished instead to remain with the young lady. Aunt Xue, with no alternative, had to relent. Thereafter, Xiangling indeed left with Miss Bao, effectively severing her previous ties. Yet she could not help but feel sorrow under the moonlight, and by lamplight she lamented quietly. Although she had spent several years in Xue Pan’s household, her delicate condition – compounded by her inherent illness – meant she never bore children; now, further agitated by anger and emotional strain, her health declined, and she eventually developed a “dry blood” disorder, growing thinner and losing her appetite, with no remedy proving effective. At that time, Jin Gui repeatedly quarreled with Xue Pan. On occasion, bolstered by wine, Xue Pan would even confront her twice. When he attempted to strike with a stick, Jin Gui evaded and ordered him away. When he nearly drew a knife to kill, she stretched out her neck defiantly. Xue Pan, unable to bring himself to strike her, raged for a while before giving up. Over time this became habitual, and it even led Jin Gui to increasingly insult Baochan. Baochan, who could not compare with Xiangling, was like dry tinder; having bonded with Xue Pan through shared feelings, he completely disregarded Jin Gui. Enraged by Jin Gui’s continual mistreatment, Baochan refused to back down. At first there were quarrels and shoving; later Jin Gui’s anger escalated to insults, and then even physical blows. Though Baochan dared not retaliate, he began to roll and thrash as if courting death, employing knives and scissors by day and ropes by night – causing endless commotion. Xue Pan, caught in a predicament he could not resolve, ended up standing by helplessly, thoroughly exasperated, and eventually left the house in despair. Jin Gui, meanwhile, secretly explained to Baochan that that very night Xue Pan was to be “married” in Qiu Ling’s room – meaning that she was ordered to accompany him in bed. At first Qiu Ling refused, but Jin Gui insisted that she must not be so particular about comfort, as it would only invite laziness in the dark hours. She further scolded, “Have you not seen our master? He clutches his maidservants so tightly that you cannot get near – what is your plan? I fear you intend to drive me to ruin!” Xue Pan, worried that this might ruin Baochan’s reputation, quickly returned and admonished Qiu Ling, “If you do not obey, I will beat you!” Qiu Ling, with no choice, had to gather her bedding and lie down on the floor, reluctantly obeying. No sooner had she settled than she was repeatedly called for tea throughout the night, and her legs were struck several times so that she could not rest for a moment. Xue Pan, having secured Baochan as if he were a treasure, ignored all else. In his bitterness, Jin Gui murmured, “Let him have his fun for a few days; when he grows distant, then I can arrange Xiangling as I wish. Then Baochan, originally mine, will be of no consequence.” Quietly enduring, she schemed to further manipulate Qiu Ling. After about half a month, Qiu Ling suddenly feigned illness, complaining of unbearable heartache and immobility, with treatments proving ineffective. Everyone remarked that it was due to her suppressed anger. After two days, unexpectedly, someone discovered a paper effigy hidden among Jin Gui’s pillows – inscribed with her age and an eight-character formula, with five needles pinned into her chest and between her ribs and limbs. Thus the household took it as news and reported it first to Aunt Xue. Aunt Xue became frantic, and Xue Pan grew even more chaotic, threatening to interrogate everyone. Jin Gui said, “There is no need to wrong the innocent; it appears that Baochan’s ‘demon-repelling charm’ must be employed.” Xue Pan replied, “But she has not spent much time in your room recently; why cling to a good woman?” Jin Gui sneered, “Who else is there?
Jin Gui said, “There’s no need to wrong the innocent; it appears that Baochan’s ‘demon-repelling magic’ must come into play.” Xue Pan replied, “But she hasn’t spent much time in your room recently; why cling to a good woman?” Jin Gui sneered, “Who else is there? Am I not the only one? Even if there were others, who would dare enter my room?” Xue Pan said, “Now that Qiu Ling follows you daily, she surely knows; question her and you will know.” Jin Gui laughed coldly, “Question whom? Who will confess? In my opinion, everyone will pretend not to know – so just drop it. In any case, even if I were to be punished to death, I wouldn’t mind; I could always remarry someone better. To be honest, wouldn’t you rather have three or more to blame me?” While speaking, she burst into tears. Xue Pan, further incensed by her words, snatched up a door bolt, stormed off, and, without a word, went straight to Qiu Ling and began beating her, accusing her without mercy. Qiu Ling protested her innocence. Aunt Xue rushed in and commanded, “Do not start beating without knowing the full story! This maidservant has served for years—was there not a time when she was careless? Would you really do such a heartless thing? Ask first before you act!” Jin Gui, hearing her mother’s reproach, feared that Xue Pan might soften his resolve, and began to bawl bitterly, “For half a month now you have monopolized my Baochan, kept her from entering my room, and only allowed Qiu Ling to sleep with me. I want to interrogate Baochan, yet you continue protecting him. Now you are so defiant as to beat her—if you kill me, then you may remarry a better one; why must you put on this farce?” Xue Pan’s anger grew ever more intense. Aunt Xue, observing how her daughter-in-law was oppressing her son, cursed bitterly. In her fury she ordered, “Sell Xiangling immediately!” Miss Bao then laughed, “Our family only knows how to buy people, not sell them – madam, you are in a state of confusion. If word gets out, won’t it be a laughingstock? If my elder brother and sister-in-law despise her and leave her to me, then I am doomed!” Aunt Xue replied, “Better to dismiss her completely than leave her with us.” Miss Bao laughed, “Whether she stays with me or not, it matters not—cut her off as if she were sold.” Xiangling had already run up to Aunt Xue, crying bitterly and pleading not to be dismissed; she wished instead to remain with the young lady. Aunt Xue, with no alternative, had to relent. After that, Xiangling indeed left with Miss Bao, effectively severing the old ties. Yet she could not help but feel sorrow under the moonlight, and by lamplight she lamented softly. Though she had spent several years in Xue Pan’s household, her delicate constitution – marred by her inherited illness – meant she never conceived; now, aggravated by anger and emotional strain, her health deteriorated further, and she gradually developed a “dry blood” syndrome, growing thinner and losing her appetite, with no effective remedy. Meanwhile, Jin Gui’s quarrels with Xue Pan grew more frequent. On some occasions, bolstered by wine, Xue Pan even confronted her twice. When he attempted to strike with a stick, Jin Gui dodged and ordered him away. When he nearly drew a knife to kill, she stretched out her neck in defiance. Xue Pan, unable to bring himself to hit her, raged for a while before giving up. Over time, this became habitual, and it even led Jin Gui to increasingly insult Baochan. Baochan, who could not compare with Xiangling, was like dry tinder; having bonded with Xue Pan over shared feelings, he completely disregarded Jin Gui. Outraged by Jin Gui’s continual mistreatment, Baochan refused to back down. At first there were quarrels and shoving; later Jin Gui’s anger escalated to insults, and then even to physical blows. Though Baochan dared not fight back, he began to roll and flail about as if seeking death, both by day with knives and scissors, and by night with ropes – causing endless havoc. Xue Pan, caught between conflicting loyalties, stood helplessly by, thoroughly exasperated, and eventually left the house in despair.
At that moment, Jin Gui asked, “Did you go with your things? Did anyone see you?” Baocan replied, “No.” Jin Gui pressed further, “And did Second Master ask you anything?” Baocan replied, “Not at all.” Jin Gui, having not slept through the night and at a loss for strategy, mused, “If I were to carry out such a scheme, others might be fooled—but how can Baocan keep it secret? Perhaps I should offer him a share so that he will have nothing to complain about. Besides, I cannot act on my own; I must rely on him to execute the plan. Let us agree on a secure course of action.” With a wry smile, Jin Gui continued, “Tell me, what sort of man is Second Master Xue Ke, really?” Baocan shrugged and said, “He appears rather foolish.” Jin Gui laughed, “You’re starting to act as if you’ve had your share of men! No wonder our elder brother could not do without you at home.” Baocan merely sneered and replied, “It is his failure to heed our Mistress’s wishes that I speak of.” Jin Gui demanded, “How has he failed my heart?” Baocan replied, “Our Mistress offers him the best food, yet he refuses to partake. Is that not a betrayal of her goodwill?” He winked conspiratorially at Jin Gui. Jin Gui scolded, “Don’t let your tongue run wild. I don’t understand your meaning.” Baocan laughed, “Don’t worry, Mistress, I have but one heart—no more to give. But these matters must be kept secret; if word gets out, it will all be for naught.” Jin Gui’s face flushed as he replied, “You, you little runt—you’re no good! It seems you’ve been busy seducing men, don’t you?” Baocan retorted, “I only act as our Mistress’s agent. As for our elder brother’s affairs, you know well what they are.” Thereafter, Jin Gui’s efforts to curry favor with Xue Ke became singularly focused on winning him over to his side. For a while, Xue Ke appeared indifferent; however, later, when Xue Ke extinguished his lamp and fell asleep, Jin Gui took that opportunity to return to Jin Gui and report to him, planning his next scheme. From that point on, Jin Gui maintained a polite façade while leaving behind only the wine jug as a signal for future rendezvous. In the meantime, Baochai’s mother and daughter noticed that Jin Gui (or, as others called him, the “golden” one) had grown unusually quiet and even affectionate in recent days—a stark contrast to his previous behavior. At home, even Madam Xue was overjoyed, thinking, “Surely this must be because when Xue Pan married, he transgressed in some way, and these past few years have been ruined. Now that such matters have come to light, thanks to our wealth and the Jia family’s influence, there is hope. Perhaps his temper will change, or perhaps Xue Pan’s fortune will turn.” This thought filled her with a rare joy. One afternoon after dinner, Madam Xue, accompanied by Tonggui, went to visit Jin Gui’s residence. Upon arriving in the courtyard, they heard a man speaking with Jin Gui. Tonggui, ever perceptive, said, “Aunt, the Mistress has arrived.” When they reached the door, a shadow slipped away behind the room. Startled, Madam Xue recoiled. Jin Gui explained, “This is my adopted elder brother; he normally lives in the village and is unaccustomed to seeing visitors. Since he hasn’t met the Mistress before, he came today but hadn’t yet gone to greet her.” Madam Xue said, “Since he is an uncle, let him come in.” Jin Gui called his brother out. After bowing and exchanging greetings, Madam Xue inquired about his trip to the capital. “When did you arrive?” she asked. The man replied, “Last month my mother, who had no one to manage the household, had me adopted, and I arrived in the capital just the other day to visit my elder sister.” Seeing that the man bore no shame, Madam Xue invited him to sit.
He then extorted a dozen taels of silver from the relatives of the pawnshop staff. Who would have thought that our Heavenly Emperor’s will would reveal such misdeeds? That very day he hurried back and lost a small silk pouch. When the pawnshop people examined it, they found many paper effigies along with seven balls of red embroidered needles. They sent it to the Jinyi Mansion, where high officials in charge of large households were questioned about the private affairs of many families. As a result, documents of clay figurines of demons were uncovered, and several boxes of incense were found. Behind an empty room hung a seven-star lamp, beneath which several straw figures stood—some with headbands, some with nails on their chests, and some with chains around their necks. In a cabinet, countless paper effigies were stored. Small ledgers recorded that a certain household was inspected and fined a certain amount of silver; expenses for oil and incense were incalculable.”  Fengjie said, “It seems our troubles indeed stem from him. I recall that after we fell ill, that old fiend came several times to Aunt Zhao’s, begging for silver, and when he saw me his face changed and his eyes resembled those of a frightened bird. I had guessed the reason then, but now it appears there was indeed cause. Yet as long as I am in charge here, there will naturally be grievances—no wonder people are angry with me. Bao Yu has no enemies; how can I endure such harsh treatment? It is unbearable!”  Grandmother Jia said, “Who knows—perhaps it is because I care so deeply for Bao Yu and Huan’er that I have inadvertently caused you troubles?” Madame Wang replied, “What can one do when faced with an ignorant person? When our elders are not properly informed, the details cannot be acknowledged; if the matter becomes public, it would bring disgrace. Let him suffer his fate—eventually, he will expose himself.” Grandmother Jia said, “You speak truly. Without proper evidence, nothing can be decided. But listen—our very own afflicted ones are worse off than most. Never mind what happened in the past, Fengjie, you need not mention it further. Today, after you and your madame have had dinner with me, you may go.”  Then Grandmother Jia ordered Yuanyang, Hupo, and others to serve the meal. Fengjie quickly laughed, “Why is it that the old matriarch is suddenly so concerned?” Madame Wang also laughed. At that moment, several wife-servants arrived. Fengjie quickly told the little maidservants, “I, along with my madame, will eat with Grandmother after dinner.” Just then, Yuchuan came and told Madame Wang, “The old master is seeking something—please attend once Grandmother’s meal is finished; go and find it.” Grandmother Jia said, “You go ahead; do not worry about the old master’s urgent matters.” Madame Wang agreed, leaving Fengjie to attend, and then returned to her own room. In her room, Madame Wang chatted with Jia Zheng about trivial matters and had the items searched for. Jia Zheng then asked, “Has Ying’er returned? How is she faring at the Sun family?” Madame Wang replied, “Young Ying has been weeping bitterly, saying that Uncle Sun is terribly fierce.” She then recounted Ying’er’s story. Jia Zheng sighed, “I knew it was not right, but Grandfather has already decided that there is nothing I can do. Ying’er must endure some grievances.” Madame Wang said, “But she is a new bride; we only hope that she will eventually thrive.” Laughing, Jia Zheng said, “What are you laughing about?” Madame Wang recounted Bao Yu’s words humorously. Jia Zheng couldn’t help but laugh and then said, “Speaking of Bao Yu, I recall something. This child, kept roaming the garden, is not doing well. If a daughter is unproductive, it is trivial; but if she is productive, it matters greatly. Recently, someone mentioned a certain gentleman from the south—a man of learning and exemplary character. I think that gentleman is very gentle. Our city children, though clever, are impetuous; if such a gentleman continues to act foolishly, it would be a waste. That is why our elders have refused to hire an external teacher, preferring instead to choose someone from within the family with some experience to teach the children.
In her dreams she continually heard voices calling “Second Mistress Baoyu,” and her doubts swelled until she ceased eating entirely—until one day she wasted away, not even drinking her porridge, her spirit nearly extinguished. What became of Daiyu’s fate… we shall leave to the next installment. Chapter 90: The Ragged Maiden Endures Agonies While a Fruit Delivery Leaves the Young Master Astonished by Unforeseen Portents  It is said that after Daiyu resolved to end her life, her strength gradually waned until, one day, she finally ceased to produce even the slightest trace of vitality. For the previous dozen days or so, Grandmother Jia and the others had taken turns visiting her. At times she would murmur a few words, but in recent days she scarcely spoke. Though her mind sometimes drifted into stupor, there were moments when she was lucid. Noticing that her illness did not appear to arise without cause, Grandmother Jia and the others had twice interrogated Zijuan and Xueyan about it. Neither dared speak a word. Even when Zijuan had once almost asked the clerk for news, she held her tongue, fearful that any further discussion might hasten Daiyu’s demise. Xueyan, whose relay of information had inadvertently helped set this tragic chain of events in motion, was even more afraid to mention a word. On the very day that Daiyu’s life finally ebbed away, Zijuan—realizing there was no hope left—kept vigil over her for a while, then slipped out to inform Grandmother, Madam Wang, and Second Aunt. “Today’s scene is utterly unlike what it used to be,” she said. Xueyan assented, and Zijuan went off. Inside the room, Xueyan sat at Daiyu’s bedside. Observing Daiyu’s half-conscious, feeble state—a condition no child had ever seen so dire—Xueyan’s heart ached with both sorrow and fear. She longed for Zijuan’s return. Just then, the sound of footsteps outside made her tense up until she recognized Zijuan had returned. Hastily, Xueyan rose and lifted the inner curtain to peer out. Through the rustling fabric, she saw someone entering—none other than the clerk whom Tan-chun had sent earlier to check on Daiyu. Noticing Xueyan lifting the curtain, he asked, “How is the young mistress?”  Xueyan nodded and called him in. The clerk followed, and upon seeing that Zijuan was absent, he inspected Daiyu. All he found was a faint, feeble breath—her life hanging by a thread—which startled him deeply. “Where is Sister Zijuan?” he inquired. Xueyan replied, “I was told she went up to the next room.”  At that moment, overcome by concern, Xueyan quietly grasped the clerk’s hand and in a low voice asked, “Was it true what you mentioned the other day—that Wang (or ‘Big Wang’) had arranged a marriage proposal for our Second Master?” The clerk answered, “How could it not be true?” Xueyan pressed, “When was it fixed?” He replied, “It wasn’t arranged very long ago. The day I told you, I had heard it from Little Hong. Later, when I visited Second Aunt’s place, I overheard her discussing with Peaceful Sister: ‘Those are but the court officials’ schemes to curry favor with the Master. Even if the First Madam disapproves, if she is willing and deems the girl good, it will be apparent to her. Moreover, Grandmother’s heart has already chosen someone—someone living in our garden. Grandmother only inquired because of what the Master said.’ I also heard Second Aunt remark, ‘As for Baoyu, Grandmother insists on a personal match—no matter who is chosen, it won’t be effective.’”  Overhearing this, Xueyan nearly forgot her despair and said, “How can that be? It seems we’ve needlessly sacrificed our only hope.” The clerk asked, “From where did you hear all this?” Xueyan replied, “You still don’t know? Just the other day, when I was speaking with Sister Zijuan, this matter was mentioned—and once he heard it, things have come to this pass.” The clerk cautioned softly, “You must speak quietly so that he may not overhear.” Xueyan whispered, “Within just a day or two…” Before they could continue, Zijuan re-entered, lifting the curtain.
The next morning, being the fifteenth day, he led his sons and nephews to perform the ancestral rite for the new moon. A careful inspection of the ancestral hall revealed that everything was as it had always been, with no odd signs whatsoever. Jia Zhen blamed himself for his drunken folly but did not mention the matter further. After the rites, the doors were closed and locked up as usual. That evening, after dinner, Jia Zhen and his wife came to the Rong Mansion. They found that Jia She and Jia Zheng were sitting in Grandmother Jia’s room, chatting and teasing her. Jia Lian, Bao Yu, Jia Huan, and Jia Lan all stood as attendants below. When Jia Zhen arrived, everyone greeted him one by one and exchanged a few words; only then did he settle on a small stool near the door, sitting sideways. Grandmother Jia smiled and asked, “How are your brothers’ arrows these days?” Jia Zhen quickly rose and replied with a smile, “They have made great progress—both in appearance and in that the bows have gained extra strength.” Grandmother Jia said, “That will do; do not overstrain, but be careful.” Jia Zhen quickly responded with several “Yes, indeed.” Grandmother Jia then remarked, “The mooncakes you sent yesterday are very good. The watermelon looks promising, yet when cut open it isn’t quite as impressive.” Jia Zhen smiled and said, “The mooncakes are from a new pastry chef; I tested them and they were indeed excellent, so I dared to prepare them as a filial offering. As for the watermelon, in previous years it was fine; I wonder why this year it is not as good.” Jia Zheng commented, “Perhaps it is due to the excessive rain this year.” Grandmother Jia laughed, “Now that the moon has risen, let us go and offer incense.” With that, she rose, assisted Bao Yu by the shoulder, and led everyone out into the garden. At that moment the main gate of the garden was flung wide open, with goat-horn lanterns hanging. On the Yuetai of Jiayin Hall, incense was being burned, candles held aloft, and fruits, mooncakes, and other items were displayed. Mrs. Xing and the others had been waiting inside for a long time. The scene was indescribably splendid—bright lanterns, fragrant incense, and a resplendent, hazy aura filled the air. On the ground lay embroidered mats for worship. After Grandmother Jia finished her incense offering, everyone bowed. Grandmother Jia then said, “The best place for moon-gazing is atop the hill.” She then ordered that the grand hall on the hill be prepared, and upon hearing this, everyone hurried to arrange it there. Grandmother Jia herself stayed in Jiayin Hall to drink tea and chat idly for a while. Soon someone announced, “Everything is ready.” Then Grandmother Jia, leaning on an attendant’s shoulder, led everyone up the hill. Madame Wang and the others said, “I fear the stone on the hill may be slippery with moss; it would be better if we sat on bamboo chairs.” Grandmother Jia replied, “What harm is there in wearing a couple more layers? This is precisely the place for moon-viewing—how could we possibly not go?” Thus, Jia She, Jia Zheng, and the others led the way; two wives held horn-shaped handkerchiefs, while Yuan Yang, Hu Po, and Lady You assisted closely; Mrs. Xing and the rest followed behind. After a short, winding walk of no more than a hundred steps, they reached the ridge of the main peak, where an open hall stood. Because it was high on the ridge, the hall was named “Tubi Mountain Villa.” Before the hall, on a terrace, round tables and chairs were arranged; a large folding screen divided the space into two sections, and all the tables and chairs were circular, symbolizing family unity. In the center sat Grandmother Jia; to her left were Jia She, Jia Zhen, Jia Lian, and Jia Rong; to her right were Jia Zheng, Bao Yu, Jia Huan, and Jia Lan. They sat in a circle, occupying only half of the table, leaving the other half empty. Grandmother Jia laughed and said, “In the past we never felt we were few in number; but tonight, it seems our family is indeed rather small—not enough, really.
Before long, tears suddenly welled up in him. At that moment, both Xiren and Mèiyuè were at a loss. Mèiyuè said, “What’s this about? What’s with all this talk of ‘Yun’ and ‘Yu’—it seems something has happened, leaving him acting so foolishly, crying one moment and laughing the next. If this drags on, how can anyone bear it?” As she spoke, she became genuinely distressed. Xiren, unable to help but smile, urged, “Oh, dear sister, don’t take it out on others. He can handle it on his own—what’s written on his note, is it really related to you?” Mèiyuè retorted, “Don’t lump everything together. Do you know what sort of nonsense is written on that note? Don’t twist it to suit your own case. If anything, it might even pertain to you!” Before Xiren could reply, Baoyu suddenly burst into laughter from his bed, jumped up, shook his clothes, and said, “Let’s go to sleep; enough of this fuss. Tomorrow I must get up early to study.” With that, he lay back down, and the night passed in silence. The next day, after Baoyu got up and groomed himself, he went off to the family school. Stepping out of the courtyard, he suddenly remembered and called out to Bei Ming and the others, “Where is Sister Mèiyuè?” Mèiyuè, coming out, asked, “Why have you returned?” Baoyu said, “Today Yun is coming; tell him not to cause a ruckus here. If he does, I’ll have to report back to Grandmother and Grandfather.” Mèiyuè assented, and Baoyu turned to leave. Just as he was about to go out, he saw Jia Yun hurrying in. Upon seeing Baoyu, he quickly greeted, “Uncle, what joyful news!” Baoyu, suspecting it was about yesterday’s incident, said, “You’re too rash! Whether one has something on his mind or not, you still come to stir things up.” Jia Yun smiled and said, “Uncle, if you don’t believe it, just wait and see. Everyone’s already gathered at our main gate.” Baoyu grew increasingly anxious and asked, “Who said that?” At that moment, voices erupted outside. Jia Yun remarked, “Uncle, can you hear that?” Baoyu’s suspicions deepened. Then a voice shouted, “You all have no manners! What is this place? Why are you all making such a clamor?” Another voice replied, “Who wouldn’t call out when the master has been promoted? How could we not come to celebrate? Other families long for such joy too.” Realizing that the news was of Jia Zheng’s promotion to Langzhong and that people had come to report the happy tidings, Baoyu’s heart filled with joy. Just as he was about to leave, Jia Yun hurriedly said, “Uncle, aren’t you happy? Your proposal will go through once again—it’s a double celebration, needless to say.” Baoyu blushed and spat, “Bah! You ridiculous fellow! Hurry up and leave!” Jia Yun’s face reddened, and he stammered, “There’s nothing wrong with it—I thought you, sir, might not…” Baoyu, with a stern expression, said, “Not what?” Jia Yun, unable to finish his sentence, fell silent. Baoyu quickly made his way to the family school, where the substitute teacher smiled and said, “I just heard that your father has been promoted—are you here today?” Baoyu smiled and replied, “I came to see the great master; I wanted to pay my respects to my father’s side.” The substitute teacher said, “There’s no need for you to come today; you have a day off. But do not return to the garden to play. You’re not a child anymore—though you cannot manage affairs, you should at least learn from your elder brothers.” Baoyu agreed and left. As he reached the second gate, he saw Li Gui coming over and stopping beside him, smiling, “Second Master, have you arrived?
But the fish, upon seeing him, scattered away, and Bao Yu swung his rod for a long time—the line remaining motionless. When a fish eventually surfaced, Bao Yu waggled his rod and scared it off. Frustrated, he said, “I am naturally impatient, yet he is slow—what shall I do? Come on, good fish, do me a favor!” which made all four laugh. Before long, the fishing line stirred slightly. Overjoyed, Bao Yu mustered his strength, scooped up the line, but when his rod struck a rock it broke in two, the line snapping and the hook disappearing. Everyone laughed even harder. Tan Chun said, “I’ve never seen anyone as clumsy as you!”  Just then, Mosyue rushed in in a panic and said, “Second master, Grandmother has awakened—she’s calling for you!” All five were startled. Tan Chun then asked Mosyue, “What does Grandmother want?” Mosyue replied, “I don’t know. I only heard that something was amiss and that Bao Yu was called to inquire; they also want Second Sister-in-law to come and investigate.” Bao Yu was momentarily dumbfounded and said, “I wonder if it’s because one of the maidservants has fallen ill again.” Tan Chun said, “I do not know; second master, please go quickly. If there is any news, have Mosyue inform us immediately.” With that, they set off together. Bao Yu went to Grandmother Jia’s room; seeing that Madame Wang was playing cards with her, he felt somewhat relieved and then turned to Grandmother. Grandmother Jia asked him, “When you were very ill a couple of years ago—when that crazy monk and that lame Taoist cured you—how did you feel during your sickness?” Bao Yu thought for a while and said, “I remember that when I was sick, I stood as if someone had struck me on the head with a stick, in such pain that my vision went black and I saw the whole room filled with green-faced, tusked monsters wielding knives and clubs. Lying on the kang, it felt as though my head was encircled by bands. When I recovered, I recall that the main hall shone with golden light, which forced all those ghosts to flee, and my head was no longer in pain—the heart became clear again.” Grandmother Jia told Madame Wang, “That description is about right.”  Just then, Fengjie entered, greeted Grandmother Jia, then turned and greeted Madame Wang, asking, “What does Grandmother wish me to ask?” Grandmother Jia replied, “Do you remember when you were possessed?” Fengjie laughed, “I do not quite recall, only that I felt as if something were tugging at me, urging me to kill someone. I felt completely overwhelmed, yet I couldn’t stop.” Grandmother Jia inquired, “And when you recovered?” Fengjie said, “It was as if someone had whispered a few words into the air, though I cannot remember what they were.” Grandmother Jia said, “In that case, it seems that was the cause. Your two sisters, both in illness, had the same experience. That wretched fellow truly had a wicked heart—you, Bao Yu, were misled into treating him as your godmother! It is only that the monk and the Taoist, by the grace of Amitābha, saved Bao Yu’s life, even though he received no thanks.” Fengjie asked, “Why does Grandmother now recall our illnesses?” Grandmother Jia replied, “Ask your madame; I am too tired to explain.” Madame Wang said, “Earlier when the old master came in, he mentioned that Bao Yu’s godmother was a scoundrel—a heretic, as they say. Now that the matter has escalated, and the Jinyi Mansion has detained him and sent him to the Ministry of Justice on a death sentence (he was reported a few days ago), that man, Pan Sanbao, who once owned a house he sold to the pawnshop at several times its value, used a scheme involving his wife contracting an evil disease to create chaos—and then claimed he could cure it by burning paper money and offering incense. He then extorted a dozen taels of silver from the relatives of the pawnshop staff.
In the end, he squandered his money on this thing and now expects us to recognize it. I say, let us not trouble him further—simply return the jade to him with a small reward of silver. Once word gets out and others know he did so, they won’t dare bring it in.” Jia Lian assented and went out. The man waited, and after a long while without anyone arriving, he grew uneasy—only to see Jia Lian storm out, clearly indignant. To be continued… Chapter 96 Concealing the News, Fengjie Hatches a Stratagem; Revealing the Plot, Pan'er’s True Nature Is Unmasked  It happened that Jia Lian, fuming in anger over that fake jade, stormed out to the study. The man who had delivered it, noticing Jia Lian’s ill humor, grew fearful and hastily rose to greet him. Before he could utter a word, Jia Lian sneered coldly, “How dare you! You worthless scoundrel! What sort of place is this? How dare you come here skulking about!” He then barked, “Where are the servants?” Almost like the roll of thunder outside, several servants answered in unison. Jia Lian ordered, “Fetch some rope and bind him! When the old master returns and makes things clear, send him off to the authorities!” Although the servants all replied in chorus, “It’s ready, sir,” they did not move an inch. The poor fellow, now utterly terrified and at a loss, realized he could not escape justice. With his hands trembling, he knelt and pounded his head before Jia Lian, pleading, “Please, Grandmother—do not be angry! I was driven to such disgrace by utter desperation. That jade was only pawned to borrow money—I never intended to keep it; I merely meant it as a trifle for the young master.” He then kowtowed repeatedly. Jia Lian spat, “You reckless, ungrateful wretch! In this household we can’t afford to waste such a useless, extravagant thing on you!” Amid the clamor, Lai Da entered, smiling as he approached Jia Lian. “Second Master, please calm down. What is he? Just let him go—order him to scram!” Jia Lian roared, “How despicable!” Lai Da and Jia Lian conspired together, and those outside jeered, “You foolish dog! If you won’t kowtow to us, then scram away quickly—don’t make us wait to kick you out!” The man hastily kowtowed twice and, like a rat, scurried away. From that day on, the streets buzzed with the scandal: “Jia Baoyu has produced a ‘fake jade.’”  Meanwhile, on that very day Jia Zheng returned from paying his respects to guests, and because of the Lantern Festival festivities—and fear that Jia Zheng might be angered by the matter—the incident was left unspoken. Add to that the busy business concerning Consort Yuan, and now Baoyu’s further ailment; though family banquets were held as usual, there was little cheer and nothing noteworthy to record. On the seventeenth day of the first month, while Madam Wang eagerly awaited Prince Wang Teng’s arrival in the capital, Fengjie entered and reported, “Today, Second Master was out when someone whispered that our great master, hastening to the capital, lost his way somewhere along the two-hundred-mile journey! Madam, have you heard?” Madam Wang was startled, “I haven’t heard anything, and the old master did not mention it last night. Where did you hear this?” Fengjie replied, “They say it was heard at Lord Shumi Zhang’s residence.” For a long moment, Madam Wang was dumbfounded; soon tears began to flow. Wiping them away, she said, “When you return, have Jia Lian find out the full details and report back to me.” Fengjie promised to do so. Madam Wang couldn’t help but weep inwardly—mourning her lost daughter and weeping for her brother—while also worrying about Baoyu. One misfortune followed another; how could all these events be contained? Her heart ached terribly. Later, Jia Lian returned with news: “Our maternal uncle, tired from the journey and having caught a chill on the road at Shili Tun, was taken ill.
Startled, Madam Xue recoiled. Jin Gui explained, “This is my adopted elder brother; he normally lives in the village and is unaccustomed to seeing visitors. Since he hasn’t met the Mistress before, he came today but hadn’t yet gone to greet her.” Madam Xue said, “Since he is an uncle, let him come in.” Jin Gui called his brother out. After bowing and exchanging greetings, Madam Xue inquired about his trip to the capital. “When did you arrive?” she asked. The man replied, “Last month my mother, who had no one to manage the household, had me adopted, and I arrived in the capital just the other day to visit my elder sister.” Seeing that the man bore no shame, Madam Xue invited him to sit. After a brief chat, she rose and said, “Stay here and have your meal with us before you go.” The man consented, and Madam Xue departed. Then, Jin Gui turned to his brother and said, “Sit down. Today, since we have passed the checkpoint, we have spared Second Master the ordeal of inspection. I must also instruct you to purchase a few items—but be sure that no one sees you.” His brother replied, “Leave that to me. Whatever you need, if there is money, I can buy it.” Jin Gui retorted, “Don’t be so loquacious; once you’ve made the purchase, I won’t accept them.” The two teased each other for a while, and then Jin Gui accompanied his brother to dinner. Later, he reminded him of the purchase and gave further instructions before his brother departed. From that day on, his visits became frequent, though an elderly doorman—who recognized him as an adopted uncle—rarely saw him return. Thus began an endless series of troubles—a story for another time. One day, a letter from Xue Pan arrived at the home of Madam Xue. When she opened it and showed it to Baochai, it read:    “Though my presence in the county spares me undue hardship, Mother, rest assured. Yesterday, however, the county’s scribes reported that the family’s case had been approved for further inquiry—so it appears our fate has reached a critical point. Yet when the case was taken up, higher authorities reversed the decision. Fortunately, the county’s Vice Minister of Culture was kind enough to immediately submit a reply to counter it, but the local magistrate has been admonished. Now the higher office insists on handling the matter personally; if they take it up, we shall suffer further. We have no more silver than this—hurry and send more without delay!”  Madam Xue wept anew upon reading it. Baochai and Xue Ke tried to comfort her, saying, “There is no time to lose.” With no alternative, Madam Xue ordered Xue Ke to attend to the matter. He quickly gathered his luggage, exchanged silver, and, accompanied by a helper from the pawnshop, set off that very night. In the chaos, even though servants were handling things, Baochai—fearing that they might not grasp the gravity of the situation—personally helped pack until about the fourth watch before resting. Alas, accustomed to the pampering of a wealthy family, she was both anxious and exhausted; by the next day she developed a fever, unable to eat even her soup. Ying’er hurried back to inform Madam Xue, who, upon finding Baochai with a flushed face and burning as if aflame, wept inconsolably. Baoqin tried to console her, and Qiu Ling also burst into tears. Baochai could not speak; she could neither move her hands nor shake her head, her eyes dry and her nose congested. They called for a doctor, and gradually she recovered enough for Madam Xue and the others to feel somewhat relieved. News soon spread to the Rong and Ning households: first, Fengjie sent a dozen fragrant “Return Soul” pills; later, Madam Wang delivered a treasured elixir. Despite treatments over seven or eight days, there was no improvement. At last, Baochai herself recalled the “Cold Fragrance Pills.” After taking three of them, her condition finally improved. Later, when Baoyu heard the news, he did not even visit her due to her lingering illness. Around this time, yet another letter from Xue Ke arrived. When Madam Xue read it, fearing Baochai would be anxious, she concealed it and went to beg Madam Wang on Baochai’s behalf, explaining Baochai’s ailment.
Tomorrow, there will be more people sent; rest assured.” Si Qi, with tears in her eyes, had no choice but to kowtow to Yingchun and bid farewell to everyone. She then whispered to Yingchun, “Even if you try to plead my case, please at least mention it on my behalf – even if it is only a small favor.” Yingchun replied tearfully, “Rest assured.” Thus, Zhou Ruijia and his group took Si Qi out. Two old women then gathered all of Si Qi’s belongings and handed them over to her. After only a few steps, they saw Xiu Ju, already wiping away tears, who handed Si Qi a small silk pouch and said, “This is from your sister – as a token of our shared fate. Since we must eventually part, take this as a memento.” Si Qi accepted it and burst into even deeper tears, crying together with Xiu Ju once more. Impatient, Zhou Ruijia urged, and the two finally dispersed. Si Qi, still sobbing, pleaded, “Please, dear aunts, show me some compassion. Let me go and bid farewell to my dear friend sister – after all, for these years we have been close.” Zhou Ruijia and his companions, all occupied with their own tasks, replied scornfully, “I advise you to leave; do not dither! We have serious matters to attend to. Who do you think you are, crawling out from your own garment? Why must you say farewell to them? You’ll only be delayed for a little while—does that count for nothing?” Irritated, he said, “Hurry up and go!” As he spoke, he led her out the rear corner gate. Unable to protest further, Si Qi followed. Just then, Bao Yu, returning from outside, saw that Si Qi was being led out with many belongings; he suspected that she was being sent away for good. Hearing the nighttime events and that Qingwen’s illness had worsened that day, he asked Qingwen in detail—but she would not say why. Now, seeing Si Qi departing, Bao Yu, overcome with grief as if he had lost his soul, hurried to stop them and asked, “Where are you going?” Zhou Ruijia and the others, well aware of Bao Yu’s past behavior and fearing that prying might cause further trouble, laughed and said, “It is none of your business—hurry and study.” Bao Yu, laughing nervously, said, “Sisters, please wait a moment—I have something to say.” Zhou Ruijia retorted, “Madame has ordered that you must not waste time. What reason could you possibly have? We only know what Madame says and cannot meddle further.” Si Qi, upon seeing Bao Yu, clutched him and cried, “What great misfortune have you done? Please, tell me—please, I beg you!” Bao Yu, with tears in his eyes, said, “I do not know what terrible deed you have committed! Qingwen is so ill, and now you are about to leave—what shall we do?” Zhou Ruijia, growing impatient, said to Si Qi, “If you do not behave as a proper lady now, I will beat you. Don’t think that you can hide behind your previous privileges and avoid your due punishment! Even if you must be a little noisy for a while, that is inevitable!” Some of the women, without waiting for further words, seized Si Qi and dragged her out. Bao Yu, fearing that they might report everything, glared after them until they were out of sight, muttering bitterly, “How strange—how strange! How is it that once a woman is married and takes on the scent of a man, she becomes so shameless, even more so than a man himself?” An old gatekeeper, overhearing, laughed and asked, “So you’re saying that all daughters are good, but every woman is wicked?” Bao Yu fumed, “Yes, yes!” Just then, several old women came in and said, “Everyone, be careful and attend to the household. At this moment, the madame herself is coming to inspect the garden.” They then ordered, “Quickly call the brothers and sisters from the Yihong Courtyard so that they may escort her out.” They added with laughter, “Ah, Amitabha! Today, once the heavens open their eyes and send this wicked little imp away, everyone will be at peace.” Bao Yu, upon hearing that Madame Wang was coming for a thorough search, was certain that even Qingwen would not be spared, and quickly fled—but later, in the midst of his anxious words, he heard nothing further.
Miss Tan Chun declined courteously and sat down opposite Miss Bao Qin; a serving clerk hurried off to fetch the bowls and utensils. Yuan Yang then pointed to the several dishes, saying, “These two dishes appear nondescript – they are what the eldest son’s household has prepared as a filial tribute. This bowl of chicken marrow bamboo shoots was sent by the elder master from outside.” As she spoke, she promptly carried that bowl of bamboo shoots to the table. After tasting a few bites, Grandmother Jia commanded, “Send all those dishes back, and just say that I have eaten them. There is no need for them to be delivered every day. I shall request whatever I desire in the future.” The wives and maidservants agreed and sent them off without further ado. Grandmother Jia then said, “Bring some rice porridge for me to eat.” Lady You immediately brought a bowl, saying it was made of red rice. Grandmother Jia accepted half a bowl, then ordered, “Take this porridge and send it to Miss Feng to eat.” Pointing to a plate of fruits, she added, “Reserve these exclusively for Ping’er.” Then she said to Lady You, “I have eaten; you now come and eat as well.” Lady You agreed, and after Grandmother Jia had rinsed her mouth and washed her hands, Grandmother Jia got up and, chatting idly with Madame Wang while dining, continued her meal while Lady You sat quietly. Grandmother Jia then summoned Yuan Yang and the others to accompany her. Seeing that Lady You was still eating plain rice, Grandmother Jia asked, “Why aren’t you having my rice served?” The maidservants replied, “Grandmother’s portion was finished. Today, an extra young lady was added, so the supply was a bit short.” Yuan Yang said, “Now everything is done ‘as much as possible’ – not even an ounce of luxury is allowed.” Madame Wang quickly replied, “In these two years when the weather has alternated between drought and flood, the rice from the fields cannot be delivered in full. And these fine rice grains are even harder to come by – so they are all used sparingly.” Grandmother Jia laughed, “That’s right: ‘No matter how skillful a wife is, she cannot make a porridge without rice.’” Everyone burst into laughter. Yuan Yang then turned to the door and told the serving maidservants, “Since that is so, go fetch the meal for Third Sister as well, the same as the others.” Lady You laughed, “Mine is enough; there’s no need to fetch more.” Yuan Yang said, “Is it enough? Am I not going to eat?” When the wives heard this, they quickly went to fetch more. After a while, Madame Wang also joined the meal. Meanwhile, Lady You stayed with Grandmother Jia, engaging her in conversation and teasing her until very late; then Grandmother Jia said, “You too, come over here.” Lady You then excused herself. When she reached the second gate outside, she got into a carriage. The serving maidservants lowered the curtain, four young footmen brought out a few vehicles, and several wives along with little maids led the way. Meanwhile, the maidservants who had been sent off earlier also returned. Inside the carriage, Lady You looked out and saw that beneath the two stone lions at the gate, four or five large carriages were parked, and she knew that these belonged to the gamblers. She said to the little maid Silver Butterfly, “Look—those in the carriages, and who knows how many riding horses!” After saying this, she entered the mansion and reached the hall. Miss Jia Rong’s wife had come out with her maidservants, all wearing their ornate head coverings. Lady You laughed, “All the time I wanted to secretly spy on their gambling, but had no chance; today, what luck – we can now stroll right past their windows.” The wives agreed and took up lanterns to lead the way. Then one of them went ahead quietly to inform the hidden footmen not to startle anyone. Thus, Lady You and her retinue sneaked up to a window where they could clearly hear inside voices offering praise and jokes, intermingled with curses and resentful laments. It turns out that recently, due to the mourning of his relative, Jia Zhen could not go out to enjoy himself and, being utterly bored, devised a way to relieve his depression.
This left Xiren in a particularly painful position—lowly and subservient in Baoyu’s presence, offering him counsel that he failed to understand. Xiren could only feel her worry mounting in silence. A few days later, after Consort Yuan’s memorial service had been held in the ancestral temple, Jia Mu and the others had spent several days seeing her off. Yet Baoyu, day after day, grew dumber in his state—he showed no fever, no pain; his eating was meager, his sleep troubled, and even his words were scattered and aimless. Xiren and Mesha were beside themselves with anxiety, and even Fengjie came to see him repeatedly. At first, it was said he had lost his temper over not finding the jade; now, seeing him so dazed and dispirited, they could only daily call for a physician. Several rounds of decoctions were given, yet rather than alleviating his condition, they only worsened it. When asked what ailed him, Baoyu would say nothing. It wasn’t until after Consort Yuan’s rites had concluded that Jia Mu, deeply concerned, personally went to the garden to see him—accompanied by Madam Wang. Xiren and the others then urged Baoyu to come out and pay respects. Though Baoyu, though ailing, would still rise to greet Jia Mu, he did so only with Xiren prodding him along. When Jia Mu saw him, he said, “My son, I have come to see what ails you. Seeing you still in this state puts my heart at ease a bit.” Madam Wang, too, was relieved. Yet Baoyu offered no answers—only a silly smile. As Jia Mu and the others sat down to question him, Xiren coached him on his replies; he answered in a manner unlike his former self—as if he were a fool. The more Jia Mu looked at him, the more suspicious he became, and he said, “When I first saw you, I noticed no illness; but now, upon closer look, it seems your ailment is severe—indeed, it appears as if your soul has wandered off. What could be the cause?” Madam Wang, realizing that the truth could no longer be concealed, looked to Xiren with pitiful eyes and quietly recounted what Baoyu had said earlier about losing the jade while he was at Lord Lin’s mansion listening to an opera—her heart troubled, she added, “Now people are searching everywhere. Diviners and fortune-tellers all claim that it’s in the pawnshop—surely it must be found.” Jia Mu, upon hearing this, sprang to his feet, tears streaming, exclaiming, “How could this jade be lost! You children are so careless! Has even the old master left it unattended?” Madam Wang, seeing Jia Mu’s anger, ordered Xiren and the others to kneel; then, with lowered head, she explained, “Daughter-in-law, I was afraid the old lady would be distraught and the old master angered, so I did not dare to report it immediately.” Jia Mu coughed and said, “This jade is Baoyu’s lifeline; now that it’s lost, no wonder he is so disoriented. This jade is known throughout the city—if someone were to take it for appraisal, who would expect you to recover it? Send someone quickly to fetch the old master; I must speak with him.” At that, Madam Wang and Xiren tearfully pleaded, “If the old lady sees you so incensed, the old master will be even more incensed. Now, though Baoyu is ailing, it is up to us to find the jade at all costs.” Jia Mu replied, “Do not worry about the old master—I have it under control.” He then ordered Mesha to go fetch someone. Before long, a message was brought in: “The old master has already dismissed his guests.” Jia Mu said, “No matter—we shall use my words. For now, let no one blame the servants. I will have Lian’er draft a reward notice and post it at the place where we passed the other day. It shall read: ‘Whoever finds it and delivers it to us shall be rewarded with 10,000 taels of silver; if someone, knowing its owner, delivers a letter along with it, they shall receive 5,000 taels.’ If it is truly found, spare no expense. But if we rely solely on our own few people, it might take a lifetime to recover it!” Madam Wang dared not contradict him.
He returned to the Yi Hong Courtyard in a gloomy state—his heart heavy and his spirit subdued. Meanwhile, Miaoyu had already reached her quarters. A Taoist nun met her at the gate, closed the door of the hermitage, and after a while recited the “Daily Chants of the Zen Gate.” After dinner, she lit incense, paid homage to the Buddha, and told the nun to rest. Her meditation mat and screen were already neatly arranged; she drew a long breath, lowered the curtain, and sat cross-legged, striving to cut off all delusions as she reached toward true Being. Around the third watch of the night, she was startled by a loud clamor on the upper floor. Fearing intruders, Miaoyu rose from her meditation and went out into the veranda. There, she saw shifting shadows across the sky and the pale glow of the moon like flowing water. Although the weather was not terribly cold, she stood alone at the balustrade for a long while. Suddenly, she heard two cats outside meowing and hissing at one another. At that moment, Miaoyu recalled Baoyu’s words earlier in the day, and her heart began to race, her ears burning with heat. She quickly composed herself and retreated to her inner room, returning to her meditation seat. Yet her mind would not settle; it raced like a stampede of horses, and she felt as if her body were no longer rooted in the hermitage. In her delirium, visions of many noble youths came to court her, while matchmakers jostled and pulled her onto a carriage; then, bandits appeared brandishing knives and clubs, forcing her to cry out for help. The sudden chaos woke the Taoist nun and other attendant nuns, who rushed in with torches to check on her. They found Miaoyu’s hands flung wide, frothing at the mouth. As they roused her, her eyes were wide open, her cheeks flushed bright red, and she shouted, “I am protected by the Buddha! How dare you ruffians threaten me?” The attendants, utterly confused, urged, “We are here—please calm down and wake!” Miaoyu insisted, “I must return home! If there is any honest soul, send me back immediately.” The nun replied, “This is your residence,” and called for other nuns to hastily pray before the Guanyin statue. They drew lots, and upon reading the lot, found that she had offended a malevolent spirit in the southwest corner. One said, “Indeed, in the southwest corner of the Grand View Garden no one resides—yet the sinister qi remains.” Meanwhile, the nuns scrambled about with water and soup. One of the nuns, who had accompanied Miaoyu from the south, devoted herself to serving her faithfully, seating herself around Miaoyu’s meditation mat. Miaoyu looked up and asked, “Who are you?” The nun replied, “It is I.” Miaoyu examined her closely and said, “Ah, it is you!” Overcome, she embraced the nun and wept, “You are like a mother to me—if you do not save me, I cannot live!” The nun called for help and gently massaged her, while the Taoist nun poured her some tea. Only at dawn did Miaoyu fall asleep. The nun then sent someone to fetch a physician. Some said her condition was due to spleen injury from overthinking, others attributed it to heat in the blood, or to an invasion of evil spirits, while still others believed it was simply an external cold; ultimately, no consensus was reached. Finally, a doctor arrived, asked, “Have you been meditating?” The Taoist nun answered, “Yes, she has meditated regularly.” The doctor inquired, “Did this ailment come on suddenly last night?” The nun confirmed, “Indeed.” The doctor explained, “This is the result of the demon within stirring up fire.” When asked if it was serious, he replied, “Fortunately, her meditation was short, and the demon’s influence was shallow—there is hope for recovery.” He prescribed medicine to subdue the inner fire, and after one dose, her condition slightly improved. Outside, rumors began to circulate among the wandering idlers: “At such an age, how can one endure this? Moreover, with her elegant yet refined nature, who knows in whose hands she will eventually fall?” After several days, though Miaoyu’s illness improved somewhat, her spirit remained unsettled, and she continued to be somewhat disoriented.
It was nothing more than speaking some idle chatter behind closed doors—do you think they’d also beat me up?” Miss Bao quickly asked, “And why did you beat her?” Miss Tan Chun then recounted last night’s events in full detail. Upon hearing this, Lady You, seeing that Miss Tan Chun had revealed everything, went on to recount what had happened with Miss Xi Chun earlier. Miss Tan Chun said, “That is just her temper – so hot-headed that we cannot fight back against her.” She then added, “This morning, when nothing was amiss, I had people inquire about Miss Feng’s condition, and they went around to ask about the situation at Wang Shanbao’s household. They later reported back to me, saying, ‘The household of Wang Shanbao received a good beating, and he is indignant at their meddling.’” Both Lady You and Miss Li agreed, “That is just right.” Miss Tan Chun coldly laughed, “This kind of matter—so as to hide the truth—is something anyone can do. Let’s wait and see.” Both Lady You and Miss Li were left speechless. After a while, the maidservants called for dinner. Xiang Yun and Miss Bao then went back to their rooms to change their clothes, and the details need not be repeated. Lady You bade farewell to Miss Li and headed toward Grandmother Jia’s side. Grandmother Jia reclined on her couch while Madame Wang was discussing how the Zhen family had been punished, with all their property confiscated and sent to the capital for trial. Grandmother Jia, upon hearing this, felt deeply uneasy. Just then she noticed her sister arriving and asked, “Where have you come from? And have you heard whether Miss Feng and her two sisters-in-law are ill today?” Lady You and the others quickly replied, “They are feeling somewhat better today.” Grandmother Jia nodded and sighed, “Let’s not concern ourselves with their affairs. Instead, let us plan our proper Mid-Autumn Moon Appreciation on the fifteenth day of August.” Madame Wang laughed, “The arrangements have already been made. I wonder, though, which place will Grandmother choose? I’m only worried that the garden might be too chilly at night.” Grandmother Jia laughed, “What harm is there in wearing a couple more layers? That is the very place for moon-gazing – it cannot be that we shall not go there.”  In the midst of this conversation, the maidservants brought over the dining table, and Madame Wang, Lady You, and the others hurried to set down their utensils and serve the food. Grandmother Jia, seeing that several plates of assorted dishes had been laid out and that two large baskets of various delicacies were also present – in accordance with the old custom for each household’s filial tribute – said, “I have repeatedly instructed you; let it be waived, for you never listen.” Madame Wang laughed, “They are but everyday things. Today I eat vegetarianly; I have no other filial offerings. Those wheat gluten and tofu dishes, Grandmother does not much care for – she only selected one with pepper-oil, watercress, and minced shrimp paste.” Grandmother Jia laughed, “I, too, fancy that dish.” Yuan Yang, upon hearing this, moved her small plate closer. Miss Bao Qin courteously yielded one by one, until everyone was seated. Grandmother Jia then ordered Miss Tan Chun to join her at the table. Miss Tan Chun declined courteously and sat down opposite Miss Bao Qin; a serving clerk hurried off to fetch the bowls and utensils. Yuan Yang then pointed to the several dishes, saying, “These two dishes appear nondescript – they are what the eldest son’s household has prepared as a filial tribute. This bowl of chicken marrow bamboo shoots was sent by the elder master from outside.” As she spoke, she promptly carried that bowl of bamboo shoots to the table. After tasting a few bites, Grandmother Jia commanded, “Send all those dishes back, and just say that I have eaten them. There is no need for them to be delivered every day. I shall request whatever I desire in the future.” The wives and maidservants agreed and sent them off without further ado. Grandmother Jia then said, “Bring some rice porridge for me to eat.” Lady You immediately brought a bowl, saying it was made of red rice. Grandmother Jia accepted half a bowl, then ordered, “Take this porridge and send it to Miss Feng to eat.” Pointing to a plate of fruits, she added, “Reserve these exclusively for Ping’er.” Then she said to Lady You, “I have eaten; you now come and eat as well.” Lady You agreed, and after Grandmother Jia had rinsed her mouth and washed her hands, Grandmother Jia got up and, chatting idly with Madame Wang while dining, continued her meal while Lady You sat quietly.
At the fourth watch, Jia Zhen finally dispersed and went to the Pei Feng Room. The next day, someone announced, “The watermelons and mooncakes are all prepared; we just need to divide and deliver them.” Jia Zhen then ordered Pei Feng, “Please see that Granny gets them delivered; I have other matters to attend to.” Pei Feng agreed, returned to Lady You, and distributed them one by one, dispatching people to deliver them. Soon Pei Feng said, “The master asks: Will Granny go out today or not? Since we are a family of filial piety, we cannot break the tradition on the fifteenth, and tonight it is just right for everyone to respond to the scene.” Lady You replied, “I really don’t wish to go out. Over there, Granny Zhu is ill again and Second Madam Lian is in bed; if I do not go, there will be even fewer people.” Pei Feng said, “The master says that even if Granny goes out, she should return early, and ask me to accompany her.” Lady You replied, “In that case, eat quickly so I can depart.” Pei Feng said, “The master said breakfast is to be eaten outside; please, Granny, eat on your own.” Lady You asked, “Who is out there today?” Pei Feng replied, “I hear there are two newcomers from Nanjing, though I don’t know who they are.” After that, they ate, changed clothes, and Lady You and the others returned to the Rong Mansion, not coming back until late. Sure enough, Jia Zhen cooked a pork dish and a whole portion of lamb, preparing a table full of vegetables, fruits, and assorted delicacies. In the Huifang Garden’s Conglü Tang, he led his wives and concubines to dine first, then laid out wine and feasted merrily under the moon. Around the first watch of the night, the sky was clear and the moon radiant, with the Milky Way faintly hidden. Jia Zhen then ordered Pei Feng and three others to join him at the table, where a row of attendants sat below, playing guessing games with coins. After a while, Jia Zhen, having drunk a bit too much and feeling cheerful, ordered a purple bamboo flute to be fetched, instructing Pei Feng to play it while the musicians and singers performed. The clear, graceful tones were deeply moving. After the performance, the order was resumed. By the time it was nearly the third watch, Jia Zhen’s alcohol level reached about eighty percent. As everyone added extra clothes and drank tea, changing cups and taking further draughts, suddenly from beneath the wall a long sigh was heard. Everyone listened intently, and their hair stood on end. Jia Zhen urgently shouted, “Who is there?” After several inquiries and no response, Lady You said, “It must be someone from the household outside the wall – we can’t be sure.” Jia Zhen retorted, “Nonsense! This wall faces no servants’ quarters; moreover, it is adjacent to the Poetry Hall – how could anyone be there?” Before he could finish speaking, a gust of wind blew over the wall. In a dazed state they heard the sound of a fan in the ancestral hall opening and closing, and the wind felt even more eerie and desolate than before. Even the moonlight, once bright, now appeared faint. Everyone’s hair stood on end. Jia Zhen, now partly awakened by his fright—still managing better than the others—felt deeply alarmed, lost his cheer, and after sitting for a while, reluctantly returned to his room to rest. The next morning, it was the fifteenth day. He then led his sons and nephews to perform the ancestral rite for the new moon. A careful inspection of the ancestral hall revealed that everything was as usual, with no strange signs. Jia Zhen blamed himself for his drunken folly and did not mention the matter further. After the rites, the doors were closed and locked up as before. That evening, after dinner, Jia Zhen and his wife came to the Rong Mansion. They found that Jia She and Jia Zheng were sitting in Grandmother Jia’s room, chatting and teasing her. Jia Lian, Bao Yu, Jia Huan, and Jia Lan all stood below as attendants. When Jia Zhen arrived, everyone greeted him in turn with a few words; only then did he finally take a seat on the small stool by the door, sitting sideways.
Lin-girl isn’t feeling well; you must hurry and get her help!” The maid and the serving girl both mumbled their “Yes, ma’am!” and hurried off. Returning inside, Tan-chun found that Xiang-yun was holding Dai-yu’s hand while Dai-yu wept uncontrollably, with Ziyuan cradling her and gently massaging her chest until her eyes gradually cleared. Tan-chun smiled and said, “I guess you’ve grown suspicious from the old maid’s words?” Dai-yu shook her head. Tan-chun continued, “They were only cursing their own granddaughter—and I heard it clearly. These sorts of insults have no reason or propriety; they never observe any taboos. How could a daughter of a wealthy family, orphaned as you are, be treated so contemptuously by someone who must have been sent by someone else? Who would dare to let such abuse happen?” Overwhelmed, Dai-yu burst into further tears. Ziyuan urged, “Tell me—what exactly is troubling you? Please wake up!”  Tan-chun consoled her, “Don’t be upset. I have come for you as your sister should. You’re so isolated now; if you take your medicine and fill your heart with pleasant thoughts, you can slowly regain your strength. We sisters still gather for poetry societies—would that not be delightful?”  Xiang-yun interjected, “But didn’t Third Sister say that you’re in no mood to be cheerful?”  Dai-yu, choking back tears, replied, “How can I be cheerful when I have no strength to face another day? I fear I simply cannot bear it.”  Tan-chun gently said, “Now, rest for a while. When you need anything, just have Ziyuan call for me.”  With that, Dai-yu tearfully told them, “Please, when you go to Grandmother’s place, only tell her I send my respects and that I’m a bit unwell—nothing serious that should worry her.”  Tan-chun promised, “I understand. Just focus on resting.” Then she and Xiang-yun left together. Meanwhile, Ziyuan helped Dai-yu lie down on her bed. The household staff took care of the other matters while Ziyuan remained by Dai-yu’s side. Though her heart ached, Dai-yu could not bring herself to cry openly. As she lay there with her eyes closed, the usual ambient sounds of the garden—the wind, the insects’ chirrups, the birds’ calls, and even distant footsteps—suddenly seemed to mingle with the cries of children, creating a dissonant clamor that grated on her already troubled soul. “Unfold the curtains,” she called softly to Ziyuan. Soon Snow-Quill (Xue-Yan) brought a bowl of bird’s-nest soup and handed it to Ziyuan. Peering through the curtain, Ziyuan gently asked, “Would you have a sip, dear?” Dai-yu murmured a faint “yes.” Ziyuan then offered the bowl to Snow-Quill, but after taking a couple of sips, Dai-yu shook her head and refused. Still, Ziyuan gently helped her settle back to sleep. After a while, hushed voices were heard outside, someone whispering, “Is Ziyuan at home?”  Snow-Quill quietly went out and, seeing Xiren, whispered that “the young miss is in her room.” Xiren then cautiously asked, “What’s the matter, dear?” as she went to investigate, recounting what had transpired during the night. Xiren’s words startled everyone, and she commented, “Can you imagine? Last night, someone’s cry of pain nearly frightened Second Master half to death!” At that, they all exchanged worried glances. Suddenly, they heard another cough from within Dai-yu’s room. Ziyuan hurried over with the phlegm-collector. Dai-yu, barely opening her eyes, asked, “Who were you speaking with?”  Ziyuan explained, “Xiren came to check on you.”  Before long, Xiren arrived at Dai-yu’s bedside. Dai-yu ordered Ziyuan to help her sit up and gestured for Xiren to sit by her side.
Though we have been apart these past few years, the moment she sees your brother again, our old matriarch, who has no sons, will cry and smile—more so than if she saw her own son. Then the siblings meet again. Who would have thought that this daughter, blossoming like a flower, is now well-educated and writes beautifully, and your brother was utterly smitten from the start. Even the pawnbrokers, harassed for three or four days, eventually had to release her. The moment your brother returned home, he begged madame repeatedly to seek her hand. Our madame had met her before and, given that their statuses matched, agreed. After discussing with the other secondary wives and Miss Feng, arrangements were made. It was just that the wedding happened so hastily that everything became chaotic. I too wished she would come earlier, and thereby added another poet to our midst.” Bao Yu sneered, “Even if so, I worry for you.” Xiangling asked, “What do you mean?” Bao Yu laughed, “What do you not understand? I fear that if another person comes along, Brother Xue will no longer show you any tenderness.” Xiangling blushed and asked sharply, “What do you mean by that? We have always respected and cared for each other, yet today you speak of such things. No wonder everyone says you are unapproachable.” As she spoke, she turned and walked away. Seeing this, Bao Yu felt a deep sense of loss and stood dazed for a long while, dejected and listless. He then returned to the Yihong Courtyard. That night, he did not sleep at all—a restless night filled with unease. The next day, he barely managed to eat; his body burned with fever. His illness, compounded by the recent humiliations, the distress of the garden searches, the dismissals of Si Qi and Yingchun, and the sorrow over Qingwen—all combined with an external chill—soon worsened, and he fell ill, confined to his bed. Grandmother Jia, upon hearing this, visited him daily. Madame Wang inwardly rued having been so harsh with Qingwen. Though her heart was heavy, her countenance remained impassive as she ordered the maidservants to attend to him diligently. Twice a day a physician was summoned to take his pulse and prescribe medicine. After about a month, Bao Yu gradually recovered. Only after a careful period of over a hundred days was he permitted to partake of richer foods and venture out again; during that time no one was allowed at the gate, and all amusements were confined indoors. Fifty days later, his condition deteriorated so greatly that it became unbearable. Despite various attempts, Grandmother Jia and Madame Wang insisted on maintaining strict discipline, leaving him little choice. Consequently, he was left to the unrestrained antics of the maidservants, who engaged in all manner of mischief—acts that had never been seen before. (The details need not be recounted further.)  Meanwhile, Xiangling, since the day she had boldly cornered Bao Yu, began to fear his advances and resolved henceforth to avoid him. Consequently, she rarely entered the Grand View Garden, and each day she was in a hurry. Xue Pan, having recently married, found that with his protective talisman the burdens on him were somewhat eased, and his life became comparatively quieter; moreover, he recognized that his new wife was a talented and refined beauty, naturally dignified and graceful. Her anticipation for the day when she would officially become his wife was ten times greater than Xue Pan’s own eagerness. At long last, on the appointed day, he became exceedingly attentive and careful in his service. It turned out that the Xia family’s young miss, now seventeen, was both attractive and had learned a few characters. In matters of inner sentiment and temperament, she seemed to follow in the footsteps of Xiangfeng. However, having lost her father at an early age and being the sole beloved daughter under a doting and overindulgent mother, she had unfortunately developed a rakish nature, regarding herself as a goddess while regarding others as naught. At home she would quarrel with the maidservants, curse and be struck. Later, after leaving the house, she was expected to manage the household herself—no longer the demure girl she once was. Upon seeing that Xue Pan’s aura was gradually diminishing, she began to assert herself. At first, she merely dominated Xue Pan, but later, by fawning and flirting, she even managed to win over Madame Wang; eventually, even Miss Bao would take note. Miss Bao, having long observed her scheming nature, often skillfully countered her words with subtle retorts.
Accustomed as she was to the pampering of a rich family, Baochai—exhausted and anxious after a night of labor—fell ill the next day, unable even to eat her soup. Ying’er rushed to inform Madam Xue, who, upon finding Baochai flushed and burning as if aflame, wept inconsolably. Baoqin and Qiu Ling also burst into tears. Baochai could not speak, nor move her hands; her eyes and nose were parched. They summoned a doctor, and slowly she recovered enough for Madam Xue and the others to feel somewhat relieved. News soon spread to the Rong and Ning households: first, Fengjie sent a dozen “Return Soul” pills; later, Madam Wang delivered a precious elixir. Despite treatments over seven or eight days, there was no improvement—until Baochai herself recalled the “Cold Fragrance Pills.” After taking three of them, her condition finally improved. Later, when Baoyu learned the news, he did not even visit her, for she remained frail. At that time, yet another letter from Xue Ke arrived. Madam Xue read it, and, fearing Baochai would be troubled, concealed it and went to beg Madam Wang on Baochai’s behalf, explaining her condition. After Madam Xue left, Madam Wang petitioned Jia Zheng. Jia Zheng remarked, “This matter must be entrusted to higher authority—but on the ground it is hard to manage; proper measures must be taken.” Madam Wang then mentioned Baochai’s plight, adding, “That poor child has suffered much. Since she is one of our own, she ought to be married soon so that her delicate body is spared further harm.”  Jia Zheng agreed, “I think the same. But her household is in chaos, and now that winter has set in and she is nearing her limit, everyone must attend to their own affairs. Let us postpone the match until next spring. After Grandmother’s birthday, we shall set a date. Convey these words to Mrs. Xue.” Madam Wang assented. The next day, Madam Wang conveyed Jia Zheng’s decision to Mrs. Xue, and Mrs. Xue, agreeing, did so. After dinner, Madam Wang accompanied them to Grandmother Jia’s room, where everyone was seated. Grandmother Jia asked, “Has the Mistress arrived?”  Mrs. Xue replied, “She came yesterday, but since it was late, she couldn’t properly greet Grandmother.”  Madam Wang then recounted Jia Zheng’s remarks, to Grandmother Jia’s delight. Soon after, Baoyu entered; Grandmother Jia asked, “Have you eaten?”  Baoyu replied, “I just returned from the study after a meal; I intended to see Grandmother first, and I heard the Mistress has come to greet her as well.” Then he asked, “Is Baochai well?”  Mrs. Xue laughed, “She is well.”  Yet Baoyu noticed that his own demeanor was less warm than before; doubts stirred in his heart as he sensed that the Mistress’s affectionate regard for him had waned. With a heavy heart, he returned to the study. That evening, after all formalities had ended, everyone went to the Xiaoxiang Hall. Upon drawing back the curtain, Zijuan announced the absence of anyone in the inner room. Baoyu inquired, “Where is the young miss?”  Zijuan answered, “She has gone upstairs. I heard that the Mistress has come, and the young miss has gone to pay her respects. Didn’t Second Master also go upstairs?”  Baoyu said, “I went but did not see any of the young ladies.”  “Really? Then where did they vanish to?”  Baoyu, confused, pressed, “I really don’t know—where did they go?”  Zijuan replied, “That, I cannot say for certain.”  Just as Baoyu was about to leave, he saw Daiyu coming slowly with Snow Goose by her side. “Sister, you have returned,” he murmured, shrinking back as he accompanied her. Daiyu led him into the inner room and invited him to sit. Zijuan then exchanged her outer garment for another and asked, “When you went upstairs, did you see the Mistress?”  Baoyu replied, “Yes, I did.”  Daiyu then inquired, “Did the Mistress mention anything about me?”  Baoyu said, “Not only did she not mention you, but she didn’t even seem as affectionate with me as before.
That jade was only pawned to borrow money—I never intended to keep it; I merely meant it as a trifle for the young master.” He then kowtowed repeatedly. Jia Lian spat, “You reckless, ungrateful wretch! In this household we can’t afford to waste such a useless, extravagant thing on you!” Amid the clamor, Lai Da entered, smiling as he approached Jia Lian. “Second Master, please calm down. What is he? Just let him go—order him to scram!” Jia Lian roared, “How despicable!” Lai Da and Jia Lian conspired together, and those outside jeered, “You foolish dog! If you won’t kowtow to us, then scram away quickly—don’t make us wait to kick you out!” The man hastily kowtowed twice and, like a rat, scurried away. From that day on, the streets buzzed with the scandal: “Jia Baoyu has produced a ‘fake jade.’”  Meanwhile, on that very day Jia Zheng returned from paying his respects to guests, and because of the Lantern Festival festivities—and fear that Jia Zheng might be angered by the matter—the incident was left unspoken. Add to that the busy business concerning Consort Yuan, and now Baoyu’s further ailment; though family banquets were held as usual, there was little cheer and nothing noteworthy to record. On the seventeenth day of the first month, while Madam Wang eagerly awaited Prince Wang Teng’s arrival in the capital, Fengjie entered and reported, “Today, Second Master was out when someone whispered that our great master, hastening to the capital, lost his way somewhere along the two-hundred-mile journey! Madam, have you heard?” Madam Wang was startled, “I haven’t heard anything, and the old master did not mention it last night. Where did you hear this?” Fengjie replied, “They say it was heard at Lord Shumi Zhang’s residence.” For a long moment, Madam Wang was dumbfounded; soon tears began to flow. Wiping them away, she said, “When you return, have Jia Lian find out the full details and report back to me.” Fengjie promised to do so. Madam Wang couldn’t help but weep inwardly—mourning her lost daughter and weeping for her brother—while also worrying about Baoyu. One misfortune followed another; how could all these events be contained? Her heart ached terribly. Later, Jia Lian returned with news: “Our maternal uncle, tired from the journey and having caught a chill on the road at Shili Tun, was taken ill. The local physicians here, lacking any reputable doctors, used the wrong medicine—and with one dose, he died. We still do not know if the rest of the family has arrived.” Madam Wang, stricken with sorrow, felt her heart break and could hardly sit. She called for Caiyun and others to help her onto the kang and, with trembling hands, ordered Jia Lian to go back to Jia Zheng with the message: “Immediately pack your things and go—assist in sorting out the affairs over there, and return to us at once so your wife may be reassured.” Jia Lian dared not refuse and reluctantly took his leave. Jia Zheng had long been aware of these matters and felt deeply troubled. Moreover, since Baoyu lost his jade, his mind had grown muddled, and no medicine seemed to help; Madam Wang’s constant worry weighed on him. That very year, during an imperial inspection of the capital, the Ministry of Works promoted Jia Zheng to first rank, and in February, the Ministry of Personnel formally introduced him. The emperor, pleased with Jia Zheng’s diligence and thrift, even granted relief for the Jiangxi grain route. Soon after, thanks were given, and the departure date was announced. Although many relatives and friends came to offer congratulations, Jia Zheng’s heart was heavy. He was constantly troubled by the unrest at home yet dared not delay his official duties. At a loss as to what to do, he suddenly heard a call from Jia Mu: “Please, Old Master!” Jia Zheng hurried inside. Seeing Madam Wang, who herself looked ill, he greeted Jia Mu respectfully. Jia Mu, gesturing for him to sit, said, “You are soon to depart on your new assignment, and I have many things to say—if only you would listen…” Tears fell from his eyes.
I have noticed that she is exceptionally mischievous and lazy. Just the other day she was ill for more than ten days. When the doctor examined her, he said it was ‘daughter’s consumption’ [a chronic wasting disease]. Therefore, I hurriedly sent her away. If she recovers, there is no need to have her return—she might be arranged to marry out. As for those girls who perform in our operas, I shall decide to let them go as well. First, they are all familiar with performing on stage and tend to speak loosely, which might mislead the young ladies; and second, when they sing and perform, it is wasted if they perform without restraint. Moreover, there are far too many maidservants—if their number is insufficient, we can always select more.”  Grandmother Jia nodded in agreement and said, “That is proper; I had been thinking along similar lines. But regarding Qingwen, I find her very promising. Her conversation and needlework surpass many others. In the future she could even be of service to Bao Yu. Who would have thought she would change so?!”  Madame Wang laughed and replied, “The ones chosen by our venerable grandmother were indeed fine—but fate has not been kind to her, so she has contracted this ailment. As the old saying goes, ‘A woman changes as she grows older.’ Moreover, those with talent inevitably tend to become a bit wayward; our grandmother has experienced much in her time.”  “Three years ago I kept an eye on this matter and quietly chose her at first,” continued Madame Wang. “I observed that she was more attractive than others, though not very mature. In general, it is better to have someone like Xi Ren first. Although a virtuous wife or a beautiful concubine should be gentle and composed, Xi Ren’s appearance—though second to Qingwen’s—would be considered first-rate in a household. Furthermore, she is unassuming and honest in her conduct; for years she has never joined Bao Yu in his mischief. When Bao Yu acts the fool, she merely urges him sternly. Thus, after two years of careful selection, everything was satisfactory. I secretly set aside Qingwen’s monthly allowance and allocated two taels of silver from my own funds for her—just so that she might know to be extra careful and perform well. And I made no mention of it publicly; partly because Bao Yu is still young and if our elders were to learn of it, they might worry about his studies, and partly because Bao Yu, being so self-assured with his own circle, would not be willing to be corrected.”  After a long pause, Grandmother Jia smiled and said, “I see. That is all very well. Xi Ren, who was once so taciturn, has been called ‘the mute gourd.’ Since you know her well, there is no great error here.”  Madame Wang then recounted how today Jia Zheng had praised the matter and taken them out on a tour. Grandmother Jia listened and grew even more pleased. At that moment, Yingchun arrived dressed up to bid farewell and head out. Miss Feng also came by to offer morning greetings and to help serve breakfast. After a short round of banter, Grandmother Jia rested for a while. Then Madame Wang called Miss Feng and asked if the new medicinal pills had been prepared. Miss Feng replied, “Not yet—for now we are still taking decoctions. Rest assured, madame, I am on the mend.”  Seeing his spirit renewed, Madame Wang took heart and then mentioned the matter of dismissing Qingwen and the other girls. “Why did Bao Yu’s maid leave home without permission? You all must not be aware. Just the other day I checked along the way—who would have thought that even the newly arrived maid from Lan’s family was so coquettish and did not like him? I told her, ‘Give her to your eldest sister,’ so that each may depart on her own. When I asked your eldest sister, ‘Don’t you know Bao Yu’s maid has left?’ she said she had been informed and that in two or three days, when Auntie’s illness subsides, she will return. In truth, her ailment is nothing serious—just a cough and sore waist every year. Surely she must have left for a reason; has someone offended her? That child is stubborn, and in a household of relatives one must be careful not to offend others, or else things will turn sour.”  Miss Feng laughed and asked, “Who can truly afford to offend her?”  Madame Wang said, “Perhaps Bao Yu himself, who has always had no filter when he speaks; he never hesitates to blurt out whatever comes to mind.”  Miss Feng laughed, “Madame, you are worrying too much.
Hurry on and complete the task. When the old master returns, you must answer according to Madam’s directions.”  Hearing this, Lai Da remarked, “Our Madam truly has a compassionate heart. Yet to have these people sent back… if they’re forced to be sent, Madam must choose someone capable. Qin Ge’er will be handed over to Second Master for punishment. As for that notice-writer, I intend to investigate thoroughly and deal with him severely.”  Jia Lian nodded and immediately dismissed Jia Qin. Lai Da then hurriedly led out the nun-like women and carried out the orders accordingly. That evening, when Jia Zheng returned, Jia Lian and Lai Da reported the matter to him. Being a man of economy, once he heard the account he casually let it drop. Only those rogues, upon hearing that twenty-four young women had been dispatched from the Jia household, could not help but think—if these people cannot return home and their whereabouts remain unknown, things will become extremely complicated. Meanwhile, Zizhuan, who had grown increasingly fond of Daiyu, noting that all was quiet in the garden, heard that the nun-like women were now to be employed in the palace. Not knowing what it was about, she went to inquire with Jia Mu. Just then, Yuanyang had come down, idle, and as they sat chatting idly, the subject of the nuns was mentioned. Yuanyang exclaimed in surprise, “I haven’t heard a word about that. Go and ask Second Madam—she’ll know.”  As they were speaking, two women from the Fu Shi household came over to pay their respects to Jia Mu. Yuanyang intended to accompany them. Since Jia Mu was napping, the two women whispered a word to Yuanyang and then departed. Zizhuan asked, “Who sent them?”  Yuanyang replied irritably, “How tiresome! Our household now has a girl, a rather pretty one, who is paraded like a treasure. She is always praised before the old lady—how well-born, how kind-hearted, ‘well-mannered, eloquent, skillful at work, literate and numerate, most filial to her elders and even exceedingly kind to the servants.’ They come with a whole spiel to extol her virtues to the old lady. I find it so annoying. These gossipy old women are extremely tiresome, yet the old lady loves to hear such flattery. The old lady is one thing, but Baoyu, who’s seen these women so often, has grown rather tired of them. Yet she holds a special preference for those whose wives are not tiresome—how strange, isn’t it? The other day she even said: ‘Among the families that have come to propose for their daughters, the master never consents; his heart is set on only marrying into a family like ours.’ After a round of praises and flattery, the old lady is completely won over.”  Zizhuan was dumbfounded for a moment, then feigned a question, “If the old lady likes her so much, why not fix her on Baoyu already?”  Just as Yuanyang was about to explain, someone from inside called, “The old lady is awake!” Yuanyang hurried upstairs, and Zizhuan had to follow. Back in the garden, as she walked, Zizhuan mused, “Isn’t there only one Baoyu in the world? You think of him, and so do I. Our own person is growing ever more infatuated! Judging by that expression, she must have her eyes set on Baoyu—those repeated illnesses, aren’t they due to this matter? With all the ‘gold’ and ‘silver’ in the household in disarray, now add in some Miss Fu—it’s just too extraordinary. I reckon Baoyu’s heart might be with our girl as well. Listening to Yuanyang, he seems to fall for every pretty face. Isn’t it that we girls have all been fretting in vain?”  Zizhuan had originally been thinking of Daiyu, but soon found herself at a loss as to whom to favor, her mind clouded with infatuation. She wished she could tell Daiyu not to worry, yet feared that might only add to her distress; seeing Daiyu like this was indeed pitiful. After much vacillation, she became agitated and scolded herself, “Why do you waste your worry on others?
Let me tell you, but don’t speak of it aloud.” He then cupped his hand around his mouth as if to keep a secret. Gathering courage, he beckoned Zijuan outside to the doorway, and in a hushed tone he said, “Sister, did you hear? They say that Baoyu has now been betrothed.” Zijuan gasped, “Where did you hear such a thing? It must not be true, must it?” Snow Goose insisted, “It’s as true as can be! Everyone else seems to know, only we hadn’t heard it.” Zijuan asked, “Where did you hear it?” Snow Goose replied, “I overheard the clerk talking—it was said that a certain governor’s family, with ample wealth and renowned talents, is involved.” Just then, they heard a cough from within; it seemed Daiyu was stirring. Fearing she might overhear, Zijuan tugged Snow Goose’s arm and peered discreetly inside. Seeing no movement, she quietly asked, “What exactly did he say?” Snow Goose explained, “Not long ago, I was sent to Third Sister’s to convey thanks, but she wasn’t in—only the clerk was there. While everyone was sitting, someone mentioned that Baoyu, in his playful mischief, is no more like a grown man than a little child—and that he is betrothed, yet still so foolish. I asked, ‘Has it been settled?’ and the clerk replied, ‘Yes—it has been arranged by some Wang, a relative from the Eastern Mansion; so there’s no need for further inquiry.’” Zijuan tilted her head thoughtfully. “That is strange indeed! But why has no one in the household mentioned it?” Snow Goose continued, “The clerk also mentioned it was the old lady’s wish. Once it is spoken of, I fear Baoyu’s wild heart might be stirred, so they keep it under wraps. The clerk warned me not to let it slip—and indeed, he did not mention it in front of Baoyu today.” Just then, a parrot squawked, mimicking, “Miss, come back! Quickly, serve tea!” Both Zijuan and Snow Goose jumped in surprise. Looking around for the source and finding no one, they scolded the parrot. Returning inside, they found Daiyu, panting slightly as she had just sat on a chair. Zijuan and Snow Goose exchanged glances over tea and water. Daiyu then asked, “Where did you two go? Now not a single soul is to be seen.” With that, she went to the kang, leaned back, pulled aside her quilt, and lay down, urging that the covering be removed. Zijuan and Snow Goose, suspecting that her earlier conversation might have reached her ears, chose not to mention it further. But Daiyu’s heart, already full of inner turmoil, had caught seven or eight parts of what they said, as if her soul were adrift in a vast sea. Reflecting on past omens and overwhelmed by bitter regrets, she resolved that it might be better to die soon rather than live on to witness unexpected misfortune. Reminding herself of her lifelong sorrow from losing her parents and the continual erosion of her life day by day, she decided that in time she would attain a state of serene detachment. With that grim resolve, she neither gathered new clothes nor cared for her meals, and simply lay down pretending to sleep. Even though Zijuan and Snow Goose attended her several times, seeing no movement she dared not disturb her. She skipped dinner entirely. After the lights were lit, Zijuan lifted the quilt to see that Daiyu had indeed fallen asleep, the blanket carelessly kicked off at the foot. Fearing she might catch a chill, Zijuan gently pulled the quilt back over her. Later, when Daiyu awoke and tried to get up, she again allowed herself to be softly covered. That night passed quietly. The next morning, Daiyu rose early without summoning anyone, sitting alone in a daze. Zijuan, upon awakening and seeing her, exclaimed, “Miss, why so early?” Daiyu replied, “It is as always; early to sleep means early to wake.” Zijuan quickly roused Snow Goose to help Daiyu dress and wash. Gazing at herself in the mirror, Daiyu stared blankly at her reflection. After a while, she noticed that her tear-stained silk handkerchiefs were completely soaked.
Lady You laughed, “In our household, people from the highest to the lowest only talk about the appearances on the outside—putting on airs and formalities, yet when it comes to actual deeds, they are perfectly capable.” At these words, Miss Li, already aware of what had transpired the previous night, smiled and said, “There is some truth in what you say. But tell me, who exactly was responsible for those deeds?” Lady You replied, “You ask me? Could it be that you were so ill as to go through the阴 (yin) period?”  Before she could finish her sentence, a servant announced, “Miss Bao has arrived!” Both quickly exclaimed, “Please come in!” and Miss Bao Cai stepped in. Lady You hastily wiped her face and rose to invite her to sit, then asked, “Why did you come in alone? The other sisters are nowhere to be seen.” Miss Bao replied, “Indeed. I haven’t seen them either. It is just that today our Granny is feeling uneasy, and the two women in the house haven’t yet been taken ill by the seasonal symptoms; the others are not to be relied upon. I, for my part, intend to go out tonight to keep the elder company. I plan to visit both the old matriarch and Madame; I think it’s nothing serious and hardly worth mentioning – after all, sooner or later I will come in again. So I’ve come to give our eldest sister a word.” Miss Li, upon hearing this, only smiled at Lady You, and Lady You returned the smile. In a short time, after Lady You had finished washing up, everyone sat down to enjoy tea with some noodles. Miss Li, still smiling, said to Miss Bao, “Since that is so, send someone to inquire about Auntie’s health – ask what ailment she has. I too am unwell and cannot come to see her myself. Dear sister, you go without hesitation; I’ll send someone to check on your room. After all, you are staying here for at least a day or two, so do not let me be at fault.” Miss Bao laughed and said, “What fault? It is only natural. Besides, you never sold out a thief. In my opinion, there’s no need to add more people; why not simply invite Yunyatou to stay with you for a day or two? Wouldn’t that be more convenient?” Lady You replied, “But what of Sister Shi? Where did she go?” Miss Bao answered, “I just sent someone to fetch your little spy, asking her to come over here, and I will let her know clearly.”  Just then, someone reported, “Miss Yun and Miss San have arrived!” After everyone had been seated, Miss Bao announced her intention to go out. Miss Tan Chun remarked, “Excellent. Not only has Aunt recovered, but her arrival, even if delayed, is acceptable.” Lady You laughed, “That’s odd—how can you start expelling relatives?” Miss Tan Chun sneered, “Precisely. If others were expelling, I’d rather expel them first. Relatives are fine, but there’s no need for them to stick around forever. After all, we are all kin—each one is no more than a clucking black-eyed chicken! I’d sooner have you devour me, and I you!” Lady You hastily laughed and said, “Where did this ill fortune come from today? It seems I’ve run smack into your sisters’ bad tempers.” Miss Tan Chun said, “Who told you to come at the peak of the heat?” Then she asked, “And who offended you this time?” After pausing to reflect, she added, “Even Feng Yatou hasn’t dared to upset you—so who might it be?” Lady You only gave a vague answer. Knowing that Lady You was reluctant to elaborate for fear of causing trouble, Miss Tan Chun laughed and said, “Stop pretending to be innocent. Besides the punishments meted out by the court—there’s no beheading—you need not be so menacing. Let me tell you: Yesterday I beat the wife of Wang Shanbao; I even bore the full brunt of punishment. It was nothing more than speaking some idle chatter behind closed doors—do you think they’d also beat me up?” Miss Bao quickly asked, “And why did you beat her?” Miss Tan Chun then recounted last night’s events in full detail.
Together in the mire we endure endless hardships—   Who knows when we shall reach the realm of emptiness?”  Finishing his verse, he considered pasting it on the wall, but feeling too embarrassed to be ridiculed, he tucked it into his book instead. He then brooded on his advancing years and the calamities that had struck his family, lamenting that with every misfortune, the fragile state of his inner world became ever more desolate. At that moment, Baocan reappeared carrying a small box. With a cheerful smile, he set it on the table. Xue Ke invited him to sit. Baocan said, “These are four plates of assorted fruits and a small jug of wine—delivered by the Mistress for Second Master.” Xue Ke replied with a courteous smile, “The Mistress has truly been thoughtful. But why did she have the little maids deliver them personally? What prompted such extra effort?” Baocan replied, “You see, among our own, there is no need for Second Master to engage in such formalities. Moreover, given our elder brother’s troublesome ways, the Mistress has long wished to send something in gratitude—but she fears that if people talk, suspicions will arise. In our family, giving gifts is simply a matter of goodwill and won’t invite gossip.” Xue Ke said, “Keep the fruits; as for the wine, let the Mistress take it back. I have little use for my wine now—one cannot indulge without reason. Surely even the Mistress and our elder sister understand.” Baocan protested, “I dare not refuse our Mistress’s orders. Our Mistress’s temperament, as you well know, is not to be trifled with. If I return it, it might be said I have not done my duty.” Xue Ke, feeling somewhat troubled, had no choice but to leave the wine with him. As Baocan prepared to leave, he peeked outside and then turned back with a smile, “Soon enough, you’ll be called upon in person to express your gratitude.” Xue Ke, uncertain of his meaning, flushed and said, “Please convey my thanks to the Mistress. It is cold, and besides, you and your kin need not trouble yourselves with such trivialities.” Baocan said nothing further, smiling as he departed. Xue Ke initially suspected that Jin Gui’s involvement in Xue Pan’s matter might have been a ruse for the Mistress to send wine and fruit to appease him. But when he observed Baocan’s furtive and uneasy manner, he began to wonder. “Could it be,” he mused, “that since Baocan is from our Mistress’s household, he has his own considerations? Perhaps he is too timid to speak plainly and uses Jin Gui’s name to divert attention. Or maybe, being a member of our brother’s household, there is more to the matter than meets the eye…” Suddenly, another thought struck him: “Jin Gui, who has never observed proper family decorum—and who sometimes, in a fit of gaiety, dresses in outrageously coquettish attire, convinced of his own beauty—might harbor ill intentions. Could it be that he and our Qin-sister have been involved in some improper affair, and have thus contrived this ploy to drag my name through the mud? Who can say?” The thought sent a shiver down his spine. Lost in these troubled musings, he suddenly heard a muffled laugh from outside—a sound that startled him greatly. Who uttered it remains to be revealed in the next installment. Chapter 93: As Baocan Schemes Amid Licentious Designs, While Baoyu Foolishly Ruminates on Zen  It happened that while Xue Ke was still deep in his anxious thoughts, he suddenly heard a laugh outside his window. Startled, he thought, “It can’t be Baocan—it must be Jin Gui.” Yet, he resolved not to pay them any further heed, waiting to see what trick they might play. For a long while he strained his ears, but there was only silence. Unwilling to even partake of the wine and fruit, he shut his door. Just as he was about to undress, he heard a slight rustle on the window paper. Already having been toyed with by Baocan the previous night, Xue Ke’s heart pounded with confusion and uncertainty. Listening intently to the faint sound, he looked closely, but found no movement—only then did suspicion seize him. He sank onto a chair by the lamp, turning over a piece of fruit in his hand as he pondered.
Grandmother Jia then said, “You all go on. Naturally, there are also officials waiting outside, so do not take them lightly. Moreover, there are more than two of you; disperse a bit, and let the young ladies enjoy themselves a little longer, so that they may rest.” Hearing this, Jia Zheng and the others ceased the game and rose, and after everyone drank a communal cup of wine, they set out with their children and nephews. Chapter 76: In Tubi Hall the Flute Is Played in Contemplation of Its Chilling Elegance; In the Concave Jing Pavilion, a Poem Is Composed in Sorrowful Loneliness  After Jia She, Jia Zheng, and Jia Zhen’s party had dispersed (details omitted), Grandmother Jia now ordered that the folding screens be taken down so that the two seating areas might be merged into one. The various wives and maidservants busied themselves wiping the tables, arranging fruits, and re-setting the cups and utensils. Once everyone had changed into fresh clothes, washed up, and enjoyed a cup of tea, they all sat down again in a close circle. Grandmother Jia, surveying the assembled company, noticed that Miss Bao’s sisters were missing from the gathering. Knowing that they had gone to complete the “Round Moon” ritual—and that Miss Li and Miss Feng were both unwell—she felt the atmosphere was somewhat subdued. Smiling, she remarked, “In past years when your father wasn’t at home, we would always invite our secondary wives to join us for the moon-viewing feast, and it was always so lively. Suddenly recalling your father’s presence now makes me think that husbands, wives, and children cannot all be together at once. And this year, though your father is here, it would not be proper to invite his wife and children to chatter and laugh together; besides, they have even increased in number this year, and it would be difficult to send them all here. Yet if we have only Miss Feng ill, one person’s banter is not worth the company of ten. Truly, it is impossible for worldly affairs always to be perfect!” With that, she sighed deeply and, as if in command, fetched a large cup to pour in some warm wine. Madame Wang laughed, “Today, with both father and children gathered, our reunion is more delightful than in previous years. In the past, even though there were many wives, it could not compare with the complete family we have now.” Grandmother Jia replied with a smile, “Exactly for that reason I am so pleased—bring me a large cup of wine. You all must also use large cups.” Mrs. Xing and the others had no choice but to exchange their small cups for larger ones. As the night deepened and fatigue set in—with most unable to stand the wine—the mood grew a bit languid. Yet Grandmother Jia’s high spirits were not yet dampened, so she continued to drink in good company. She then commanded that thick felt blankets be spread on the steps and that mooncakes, watermelons, fruits, and other refreshments be brought down. She also ordered the maidservants and wives to sit closely together to admire the moon. Grandmother Jia, looking up at the moon now high in the sky, remarked that its beauty was more enchanting than ever before, and she said, “Such a splendid moon calls for the sound of the flute.” She then ordered that a performance by a female musician be arranged. “Too much music can sometimes lose its refinement—let the flute alone be played from afar; that will suffice.”  No sooner had she spoken than, as the musician began to play, a servant of Mrs. Xing’s approached her mistress with a few words. Grandmother Jia inquired, “What is it?” Mrs. Xing replied, “Just now, when the eldest master went out, he tripped on a stone and twisted his leg.” Hearing this, Grandmother Jia immediately ordered two old women to go and examine him, and she also sent Mrs. Xing off to check on him. Mrs. Xing then excused herself and departed. Grandmother Jia added, “Then, let Zhen’s daughter-in-law leave at once so that I may go to sleep.” Lady You protested with a laugh, “I’m not going back today—I insist on keeping the old matriarch’s company throughout the night.” Grandmother Jia replied with a smile, “That won’t do.
Overcome with emotion, he spontaneously composed a song:    In the pond one night, the autumn wind is cold,   Scattering the ruby shadows of lotus and water-chestnut. The water caltrop and the arrowhead-lily weep in despair,   Heavy dew and abundant frost oppress the slender stems. Not a sound of endless chess moves is heard in the day,   While sticky clay dots stain the game board. Ancient men lament parting and cherish their friends;   How much more do I now feel the bond of kinship! Barely finishing his verse, Bao Yu suddenly heard someone behind him laughing, “What are you spacing out for again?” Bao Yu turned around quickly to see who it was; it turned out to be Xiangling. Bao Yu quickly turned and asked with a smile, “Sister, what brings you here at this hour? It has been many days since you last came in to wander about.” Xiangling clapped her hands merrily and said, “I have never been reluctant to come. Now that your brother has returned, he is freer than before. Just earlier, our madame sent someone to call on Feng, but they could not find her—so they said she had come to the garden. Hearing this, I was assigned to go look for her. I encountered her maid who said she was in Daoxiang Village. Now, as I head to Daoxiang Village, I happened to meet you again. I also wish to ask: Has sister Xi Ren been well these past days? And why is it that sister Qingwen is nowhere to be seen? The second daughter left so quickly—look, the place is suddenly so empty.” Bao Yu could only agree and then asked her to join him for tea in the Yihong Courtyard. Xiangling said, “I cannot go at the moment; I must first see Second Aunt, and after we discuss proper matters I will come.” Bao Yu asked, “What proper matters? Why such haste?” Xiangling replied, “It is about your brother’s marriage. That is most important.” Bao Yu said, “Which family is considered favorable? I have only heard half a year’s worth of noise—yesterday someone spoke highly of the Zhang family, tomorrow they will praise the Li family, and the day after, they will discuss how fine the Wang family is. Yet these young ladies, it seems, have incurred some sin that has led others to criticize them.” Xiangling said, “Once it is settled, there is no need to involve others.” Bao Yu asked, “Settled with which family?” Xiangling replied, “Because when your brother went out the other day, he happened to visit a relative’s house. This relative, being an old kin and also a well-known merchant in the Ministry of Revenue, was known in the capital—from the highest nobles to the common traders, all referring to his family as the ‘Guihua Xia Family.’” Bao Yu laughed, “How can they also be called the ‘Guihua Xia Family’?” Xiangling explained, “Their surname is Xia—they are extremely wealthy. They own dozens of hectares planted with osmanthus; in Chang’an, both inside and outside the city, every osmanthus bureau belongs to them, and even the potted displays in the palace come from their offerings. That is why their family is so well known. Now that your father is gone, only the old matriarch remains with a daughter of her own—but alas, all her sons have perished. It is a pity they have lost all descendants.” Bao Yu hastily said, “Let’s not worry about whether they will have heirs—what matters is, is that daughter favorable? Why did your elder brother favor her?” Xiangling smiled, “For one, fate has its way; and also, ‘beauty is in the eye of the beholder.’ In days past we were very close as cousins, playing together from childhood. Though we have been apart these past few years, the moment she sees your brother again, our old matriarch, who has no sons, will cry and smile—more so than if she saw her own son. Then the siblings meet again. Who would have thought that this daughter, blossoming like a flower, is now well-educated and writes beautifully, and your brother was utterly smitten from the start. Even the pawnbrokers, harassed for three or four days, eventually had to release her. The moment your brother returned home, he begged madame repeatedly to seek her hand.
It’s only a few fruits—what’s there to fuss over? I have no doubt in you.”  Just then, Bao Er came in and kowtowed, saying, “Master, please forgive that I am still out here serving.”  Jia Zhen said, “What’s the meaning of this?”  Bao Er replied, “I find I cannot speak up properly in this place.”  Jia Zhen scolded, “Who told you to speak up?”  Bao Er answered, “Why must I act as if I were a mere ornament?”  Zhou Rui then interjected, “I manage the accounts of the estate, handling the income and expenses of the manor’s silver—amounting to some three to five hundred thousand a year. The Master, Mistress, and the old lady have never complained; how can these trifling items be an issue? If you listen to Bao Er, it might as well seem as though all the fields and properties have been taken over by us servants.”  Jia Zhen thought, “It must be Bao Er trying to stir up trouble.” He then said to Bao Er, “Be off with you!” and turned to Zhou Rui, “You need not say more; just mind your work.” The two dispersed. While Jia Zhen was resting in his study, he heard a tumult outside that sounded like a storm, and he sent someone to investigate. The messenger returned, “It seems that Bao Er and Zhou Rui’s adopted son have gotten into a fight.”  Jia Zhen asked, “Who is Zhou Rui’s adopted son?”  The messenger replied, “He is called He San. He was once a good-for-nothing, always idling around at home drinking and causing mischief at the gate. When he heard Bao Er and Zhou Rui bickering, he inserted himself into the fray.”  Jia Zhen said, “That is despicable! Bind both Bao Er and that He San together.”  He then asked, “What about Zhou Rui?”  The messenger replied, “He left as soon as the fight broke out.”  Jia Zhen said, “Bring him in as well. This is intolerable!”  The servants agreed. Amid the clamor, Jia Lian also returned. Jia Zhen relayed the incident to him. Jia Lian remarked, “This is really something.” Then he sent someone to fetch Zhou Rui. Knowing he couldn’t avoid it, Zhou Rui eventually appeared. Jia Zhen ordered, “Tie them all up!”  Jia Lian then said to Zhou Rui, “Don’t worry about what you said earlier; Master has already made his decision. Why must there be fights outside? You even let that bastard He San cause trouble. If you do not subdue them, they’ll run wild!” He then gave Zhou Rui several kicks. Jia Zhen said, “Beating Zhou Rui alone won’t do.” He ordered the men to flog Bao Er and He San fifty lashes each, then they were marched out. Only then did Jia Zhen and Jia Lian retire to discuss other matters. In the meantime, the servants began to whisper among themselves. Some said Jia Zhen was being overprotective; others said he was incompetent at mediating. Some remarked that he wasn’t a good person at all, “Just the other day, when the You family sisters caused such a scandal, wasn’t it Bao Er whom he mediated by calling Second Master over? And now he complains that Bao Er is not useful—surely it’s because Bao Er’s mistress is no longer attentive.” With so many voices, everyone had their own opinion. Meanwhile, ever since Jia Zheng had been appointed as the imperial seal keeper in the Ministry of Works, the family had been prospering. When Jia Yun heard about this, he also wished to get involved. So he went outside and spoke with a few foremen, negotiated a price, and purchased some fashionable embroidered goods, intending to use his connection through Sister Feng. At that time, Sister Feng was indoors when she overheard the maidservants saying, “Both the eldest and second masters are furious—they got into a fight outside.” Not knowing the cause, Sister Feng was about to send someone to inquire when Jia Lian entered and recounted the events from outside.
Grandmother Jia, seeing that several plates of assorted dishes had been laid out and that two large baskets of various delicacies were also present – in accordance with the old custom for each household’s filial tribute – said, “I have repeatedly instructed you; let it be waived, for you never listen.” Madame Wang laughed, “They are but everyday things. Today I eat vegetarianly; I have no other filial offerings. Those wheat gluten and tofu dishes, Grandmother does not much care for – she only selected one with pepper-oil, watercress, and minced shrimp paste.” Grandmother Jia laughed, “I, too, fancy that dish.” Yuan Yang, upon hearing this, moved her small plate closer. Miss Bao Qin courteously yielded one by one, until everyone was seated. Grandmother Jia then ordered Miss Tan Chun to join her at the table. Miss Tan Chun declined courteously and sat down opposite Miss Bao Qin; a serving clerk hurried off to fetch the bowls and utensils. Yuan Yang then pointed to the several dishes, saying, “These two dishes appear nondescript – they are what the eldest son’s household has prepared as a filial tribute. This bowl of chicken marrow bamboo shoots was sent by the elder master from outside.” As she spoke, she promptly carried that bowl of bamboo shoots to the table. After tasting a few bites, Grandmother Jia commanded, “Send all those dishes back, and just say that I have eaten them. There is no need for them to be delivered every day. I shall request whatever I desire in the future.” The wives and maidservants agreed and sent them off without further ado. Grandmother Jia then said, “Bring some rice porridge for me to eat.” Lady You immediately brought a bowl, saying it was made of red rice. Grandmother Jia accepted half a bowl, then ordered, “Take this porridge and send it to Miss Feng to eat.” Pointing to a plate of fruits, she added, “Reserve these exclusively for Ping’er.” Then she said to Lady You, “I have eaten; you now come and eat as well.” Lady You agreed, and after Grandmother Jia had rinsed her mouth and washed her hands, Grandmother Jia got up and, chatting idly with Madame Wang while dining, continued her meal while Lady You sat quietly. Grandmother Jia then summoned Yuan Yang and the others to accompany her. Seeing that Lady You was still eating plain rice, Grandmother Jia asked, “Why aren’t you having my rice served?” The maidservants replied, “Grandmother’s portion was finished. Today, an extra young lady was added, so the supply was a bit short.” Yuan Yang said, “Now everything is done ‘as much as possible’ – not even an ounce of luxury is allowed.” Madame Wang quickly replied, “In these two years when the weather has alternated between drought and flood, the rice from the fields cannot be delivered in full. And these fine rice grains are even harder to come by – so they are all used sparingly.” Grandmother Jia laughed, “That’s right: ‘No matter how skillful a wife is, she cannot make a porridge without rice.’” Everyone burst into laughter. Yuan Yang then turned to the door and told the serving maidservants, “Since that is so, go fetch the meal for Third Sister as well, the same as the others.” Lady You laughed, “Mine is enough; there’s no need to fetch more.” Yuan Yang said, “Is it enough? Am I not going to eat?” When the wives heard this, they quickly went to fetch more. After a while, Madame Wang also joined the meal. Meanwhile, Lady You stayed with Grandmother Jia, engaging her in conversation and teasing her until very late; then Grandmother Jia said, “You too, come over here.” Lady You then excused herself. When she reached the second gate outside, she got into a carriage. The serving maidservants lowered the curtain, four young footmen brought out a few vehicles, and several wives along with little maids led the way. Meanwhile, the maidservants who had been sent off earlier also returned. Inside the carriage, Lady You looked out and saw that beneath the two stone lions at the gate, four or five large carriages were parked, and she knew that these belonged to the gamblers. She said to the little maid Silver Butterfly, “Look—those in the carriages, and who knows how many riding horses!” After saying this, she entered the mansion and reached the hall.
Even if the authorities approve, he is a failure. You, my nephew, are wiser than your elder brother—I now place my hopes in you. Learn well from now on. Moreover, the daughter-in-law you have taken does not compare to what we had before. A girl’s marriage is never easy; if a husband is capable, then she will have a future. But if Miss Xing turns out to be like this…” She trailed off, gesturing inwardly, “I need not say more. Miss Xing indeed possesses both modest means and self-respect. Once our affairs are settled, and you complete your proper tasks, I too shall have one less worry.” Xue Ke replied, “Sister, the matter of the Qin-sister’s departure has been a great worry for the Mistress. As for that matter—what is there to be said?” They spoke idly for a while. Then Xue Ke returned to his room. After dinner, he recalled that Xiuyan—now residing in the Jia Garden—is a poor orphan forced to rely on others, barely managing her daily needs. Knowing her well from the day she arrived, with her appearance and character fully understood, he could only sigh over fate’s injustice: how is it that one like the affluent and pampered Xia Jingui is so fortunate, while Xiuyan must suffer? He mused bitterly on how the King of Hell might have judged them. Overwhelmed with melancholy, he attempted to compose a poem to vent his sorrow:    “Like a dragon deprived of water, a fish left to dry,   Two hearts, each in their separate lands, suffer in solitude. Together in the mire we endure endless hardships—   Who knows when we shall reach the realm of emptiness?”  Finishing his verse, he considered pasting it on the wall, but feeling too embarrassed to be ridiculed, he tucked it into his book instead. He then brooded on his advancing years and the calamities that had struck his family, lamenting that with every misfortune, the fragile state of his inner world became ever more desolate. At that moment, Baocan reappeared carrying a small box. With a cheerful smile, he set it on the table. Xue Ke invited him to sit. Baocan said, “These are four plates of assorted fruits and a small jug of wine—delivered by the Mistress for Second Master.” Xue Ke replied with a courteous smile, “The Mistress has truly been thoughtful. But why did she have the little maids deliver them personally? What prompted such extra effort?” Baocan replied, “You see, among our own, there is no need for Second Master to engage in such formalities. Moreover, given our elder brother’s troublesome ways, the Mistress has long wished to send something in gratitude—but she fears that if people talk, suspicions will arise. In our family, giving gifts is simply a matter of goodwill and won’t invite gossip.” Xue Ke said, “Keep the fruits; as for the wine, let the Mistress take it back. I have little use for my wine now—one cannot indulge without reason. Surely even the Mistress and our elder sister understand.” Baocan protested, “I dare not refuse our Mistress’s orders. Our Mistress’s temperament, as you well know, is not to be trifled with. If I return it, it might be said I have not done my duty.” Xue Ke, feeling somewhat troubled, had no choice but to leave the wine with him. As Baocan prepared to leave, he peeked outside and then turned back with a smile, “Soon enough, you’ll be called upon in person to express your gratitude.” Xue Ke, uncertain of his meaning, flushed and said, “Please convey my thanks to the Mistress. It is cold, and besides, you and your kin need not trouble yourselves with such trivialities.” Baocan said nothing further, smiling as he departed. Xue Ke initially suspected that Jin Gui’s involvement in Xue Pan’s matter might have been a ruse for the Mistress to send wine and fruit to appease him. But when he observed Baocan’s furtive and uneasy manner, he began to wonder. “Could it be,” he mused, “that since Baocan is from our Mistress’s household, he has his own considerations? Perhaps he is too timid to speak plainly and uses Jin Gui’s name to divert attention. Or maybe, being a member of our brother’s household, there is more to the matter than meets the eye…” Suddenly, another thought struck him: “Jin Gui, who has never observed proper family decorum—and who sometimes, in a fit of gaiety, dresses in outrageously coquettish attire, convinced of his own beauty—might harbor ill intentions.
In my humble opinion, if we ask and it comes out, Madam, how do you propose we handle it?”  Madam Wang asked, “Where are those girls now?”  Jia Lian answered, “They are all locked in the garden.”  “Do the young ladies know?” asked Madam Wang. “They seem to think it’s a matter pertaining to the palace, and nothing else is mentioned outside,” Jia Lian explained. “Very well. This matter cannot be delayed even for a moment. Initially I intended to send them away, but you all insisted they be kept. Now that trouble has arisen, you must tell Lai Da to go back to his original establishment and inquire carefully whether there are any of his kin involved. Get the official documents checked, spend perhaps a few dozen taels of silver to hire a boat and assign a reliable person to deliver everything back to their home, and also return all the documents. That way nothing will be amiss. If, however, it turns out that one or two bad apples have reverted to secular ways, then to detain everyone would be too grievous a sin. And if the matter were to be made public to the authorities—even if we forgo our dowries—if they sell the jade, who would care about their lives? As for Qin’er, give him a good scolding; aside from the ancestral rites and celebrations, he need not be summoned here. Should he inadvertently come into conflict with the old master’s anger, he’ll be in deep trouble. Also, inform the accounts office to cancel the entry for this item of grain and provisions. Then, send someone to Shuiyue Nunnery to relay the old master’s command that aside from the ritual of burning paper for the ancestors, no man from his family is allowed to enter. Should there be any more unfavorable news, even the old maid must be expelled as well.”  Jia Lian agreed to every word. He then went out to relay Madam Wang’s orders to Lai Da, saying, “Madam’s instructions are for you to proceed exactly as she said. Once you have finished, report back to me so I can in turn report to Madam. Hurry on and complete the task. When the old master returns, you must answer according to Madam’s directions.”  Hearing this, Lai Da remarked, “Our Madam truly has a compassionate heart. Yet to have these people sent back… if they’re forced to be sent, Madam must choose someone capable. Qin Ge’er will be handed over to Second Master for punishment. As for that notice-writer, I intend to investigate thoroughly and deal with him severely.”  Jia Lian nodded and immediately dismissed Jia Qin. Lai Da then hurriedly led out the nun-like women and carried out the orders accordingly. That evening, when Jia Zheng returned, Jia Lian and Lai Da reported the matter to him. Being a man of economy, once he heard the account he casually let it drop. Only those rogues, upon hearing that twenty-four young women had been dispatched from the Jia household, could not help but think—if these people cannot return home and their whereabouts remain unknown, things will become extremely complicated. Meanwhile, Zizhuan, who had grown increasingly fond of Daiyu, noting that all was quiet in the garden, heard that the nun-like women were now to be employed in the palace. Not knowing what it was about, she went to inquire with Jia Mu. Just then, Yuanyang had come down, idle, and as they sat chatting idly, the subject of the nuns was mentioned. Yuanyang exclaimed in surprise, “I haven’t heard a word about that. Go and ask Second Madam—she’ll know.”  As they were speaking, two women from the Fu Shi household came over to pay their respects to Jia Mu. Yuanyang intended to accompany them. Since Jia Mu was napping, the two women whispered a word to Yuanyang and then departed. Zizhuan asked, “Who sent them?”  Yuanyang replied irritably, “How tiresome! Our household now has a girl, a rather pretty one, who is paraded like a treasure. She is always praised before the old lady—how well-born, how kind-hearted, ‘well-mannered, eloquent, skillful at work, literate and numerate, most filial to her elders and even exceedingly kind to the servants.’ They come with a whole spiel to extol her virtues to the old lady.
Jin Gui said, “There is no need to wrong the innocent; it appears that Baochan’s ‘demon-repelling charm’ must be employed.” Xue Pan replied, “But she has not spent much time in your room lately; why cling to a good woman?” Jin Gui sneered, “Who else is there? Am I not the only one? Even if there were others, who would dare enter my room?” Xue Pan said, “Now that Qiu Ling follows you every day, she surely knows; question her and you will find out.” Jin Gui laughed coldly, “Question whom? Who will confess? In my opinion, they will all pretend not to know – so let it drop. Besides, even if I were to be punished to death, it matters little; I could always remarry someone better. Truly, if you complain, who will not blame me?” With tears streaming down, she continued, “Then why must you involve everyone? I fear I will be blamed if you persist.” Xue Pan’s anger mounted further, and he seized a door bolt, stormed off, and without further ado confronted Qiu Ling, accusing her bluntly. Qiu Ling cried out in protest. Aunt Xue rushed in and commanded, “Do not start beating her until you know the whole truth! This maidservant has served for years—wasn’t there a time when she made a mistake? Would you really be so heartless? Ask clearly first, then act!” Hearing this, Jin Gui feared that Xue Pan might soften and began to weep bitterly, “For half a month you have monopolized my Baochan, kept her from entering my room, and only allowed Qiu Ling to sleep with me. I wish to question Baochan, yet you continue protecting him. Now you act so defiantly as to beat her—if you kill me, then remarry as you please; why must you put on this farce?” Xue Pan’s anger grew even more. Aunt Xue, seeing how her daughter-in-law oppressed her son, cursed bitterly. In her fury she ordered, “Sell Xiangling immediately!” Miss Bao then laughed, “Our family only knows how to buy people, not sell them—madam, you are completely confused. If word gets out, won’t it be a laughingstock? If my elder brother and sister-in-law despise her and leave her to me, I’m doomed!” Aunt Xue replied, “Better to dismiss her entirely than allow her to remain with us.” Miss Bao laughed, “Whether she stays with me or not is immaterial—cut her off as if she were sold.” Xiangling had already run up to Aunt Xue, pleading bitterly and crying, unwilling to leave; she wished instead to remain with the young lady. Aunt Xue, with no alternative, had to relent. Thereafter, Xiangling left with Miss Bao, effectively severing her ties with the past. Yet she could not help but feel sorrow beneath the moonlight, and by lamplight she quietly lamented. Although she had spent several years in Xue Pan’s household, her delicate condition – worsened by her inherent illness – meant she never bore children; now, further aggravated by anger and distress, her health declined, and she eventually developed a “dry blood” disorder, growing thinner and losing her appetite with no remedy proving effective. Meanwhile, Jin Gui continued to quarrel with Xue Pan. On occasion, emboldened by wine, he confronted her twice. When he tried to strike with a stick, Jin Gui dodged and ordered him away. When he nearly drew a knife, she stretched out her neck defiantly. Unable to bring himself to hit her, Xue Pan raged for a while before giving up. In time, this became habitual, and Jin Gui’s insults to Baochan grew ever more severe. Baochan, who could not compare with Xiangling, was like dry tinder; having bonded with Xue Pan through shared sentiments, he completely disregarded Jin Gui. Outraged by her continual mistreatment, Baochan refused to relent. At first there were verbal spats and shoving; later Jin Gui’s anger escalated to physical blows. Though Baochan dared not retaliate, he began to thrash about as if courting death – by day with knives and scissors, by night with ropes – causing endless commotion. Xue Pan, caught between loyalties he could not resolve, eventually stood helplessly by, thoroughly exasperated, and left the house in despair. Jin Gui, meanwhile, secretly explained to Baochan that that very night Xue Pan was to be “married” in Qiu Ling’s room – meaning she was to be forced to accompany him in bed.
Then Jin Gui said, “If you have something to say, speak openly instead of sneaking around.” Taking advantage of the wine and his obscured face, Xue Pan then suddenly knelt on the bed, grabbed Jin Gui’s hand and laughed, “Dear sister, if you award Baochan to me, then do as you wish. If you want to keep your wits about you, I can even fetch you one—whatever pleases you.” Jin Gui laughed, “That is absurd! If you love someone, simply keep them in your room so that no one sees you behaving indecently. What do I want with such nonsense?” Xue Pan, delighted by her words, thanked her profusely. That very night, in a display of all that a husband might do to please his wife, Xue Pan spared no effort in fawning over Jin Gui. The next day he stayed home, engaging in boisterous antics that emboldened him even further. By mid-afternoon, Jin Gui purposely went out, leaving an opening for the two to be alone. Xue Pan then began to pull and cajole her, and Baochan—aware of what was about to happen—half-heartedly complied. Just as they were about to depart for a secret rendezvous, Jin Gui, having anticipated the moment, called a little maid (a boy servant known as Xiao She’er) over. This little maid, who had been in Jin Gui’s service since childhood – orphaned early and known affectionately as “Little She’er” for doing rough work – was summoned by Jin Gui with the order, “Go tell Qiu Ling to come to my room and fetch my silk cloth; do not mention that I said so.” Xiao She’er hurried off to find Qiu Ling, saying, “Miss Ling, the madam’s silk cloth was forgotten in the room. Please go get it and bring it up—it would be well.” Qiu Ling, who had been trying to salvage Jin Gui’s recent setbacks (and did not quite know what to make of the situation), rushed in to retrieve the cloth. Alas, as she was about to hand it over, she collided with the two in a rush, and her face flushed bright red with embarrassment as she quickly turned away. Xue Pan, feeling he had made his move, considered himself successful – for besides Jin Gui, no one else was to be feared, and he left the door unlatched. At that moment Qiu Ling arrived; although she was not overly perturbed, Baochan – who was known for her stubborn tongue – could not help but resent the encounter, accusing him of “using force.” Xue Pan, having barely managed to placate her, found himself ultimately rebuffed by Qiu Ling, who pushed him away and fled, bitterly cursing that he was “using his strength to force his way.” Though Xue Pan had almost managed to win her over, Qiu Ling’s rejection transformed his initial excitement into outright fury, and he vented all his anger on her. Without further ado, he rushed out, hurling insults at Qiu Ling, calling her “a damned harlot!” and accusing her of “roaming like a ghost among the dead.” Qiu Ling, fearing further trouble, scampered off. Xue Pan later sought Baochan again but found no trace of her. Enraged, he cursed Qiu Ling. That evening, after dinner, when Xue Pan had become thoroughly drunk, while bathing he discovered the water was slightly too hot and scalded his feet—then he claimed that Qiu Ling had deliberately done this to harm him. Stripped bare, he charged at Qiu Ling and struck her twice. Though Qiu Ling did not suffer long from this, by that time she was forced to resign herself, gathering her few belongings and leaving. At this point, Jin Gui secretly informed Baochan that tonight Xue Pan was to be “married” in Qiu Ling’s room – that is, she was ordered to accompany Jin Gui in bed. At first Qiu Ling refused, but Jin Gui scolded that she was being too fussy and, fearing that the labor at night would be too much, insisted. She was also rebuked, “Have you not seen how our master behaves? He takes every opportunity to monopolize my maidservants, and he never allows you to come near – what is your plan? I fear you intend to drive me to despair!” Xue Pan, alarmed that such matters might spoil Baochan’s reputation, quickly returned to berate Qiu Ling, “If you do not come, I will beat you!” Reluctantly, Qiu Ling had no choice but to bring her bedding.
Qiu Ling cried out in protest. Aunt Xue rushed in and commanded, “Do not start beating her until you know the whole truth! This maidservant has served for years—was there not a time when she made a mistake? Would you really do something so heartless? Ask clearly first, then act!” Hearing this, Jin Gui feared that Xue Pan might soften and began to weep bitterly, “For half a month you have monopolized my Baochan, kept her from entering my room, and only allowed Qiu Ling to sleep with me. I wish to question Baochan, yet you continue protecting him. Now you act so defiantly as to beat her—if you kill me, then remarry as you please; why must you put on this farce?” Xue Pan’s anger grew even more. Aunt Xue, seeing how her daughter-in-law oppressed her son, cursed bitterly. In her fury she ordered, “Sell Xiangling immediately!” Miss Bao then laughed, “Our family only knows how to buy people, not sell them—madam, you are completely confused. If word gets out, won’t it be a laughingstock? If my elder brother and sister-in-law despise her and leave her to me, I’m doomed!” Aunt Xue replied, “Better to dismiss her entirely than let her remain with us.” Miss Bao laughed, “Whether she stays with me or not is of no consequence—cut her off as if she were sold.” Xiangling had already run up to Aunt Xue, pleading bitterly and crying, unwilling to leave; she wished instead to remain with the young lady. Aunt Xue, with no alternative, had to relent. After that, Xiangling left with Miss Bao, effectively severing her ties with the past. Yet she could not help but feel sorrow under the moonlight, and by lamplight she quietly lamented. Although she had spent several years in Xue Pan’s household, her delicate condition – worsened by her inherited illness – meant she never bore children; now, further aggravated by anger and distress, her health declined, and she eventually developed a “dry blood” disorder, growing thinner and losing her appetite with no remedy proving effective. Meanwhile, Jin Gui continued to quarrel with Xue Pan. On occasion, bolstered by wine, he confronted her twice. When he tried to strike with a stick, Jin Gui dodged and ordered him away. When he nearly drew a knife, she stretched out her neck defiantly. Unable to bring himself to hit her, Xue Pan raged for a while before giving up. Over time, this became habitual, and Jin Gui’s insults toward Baochan grew ever more severe. Baochan, who could not compare with Xiangling, was like dry tinder; having bonded with Xue Pan through shared feelings, he completely disregarded Jin Gui. Outraged by her continual mistreatment, Baochan refused to relent. At first there were verbal spats and shoving; later Jin Gui’s anger escalated to physical blows. Though Baochan dared not fight back, he began to thrash about as if courting death – by day with knives and scissors, by night with ropes – causing endless commotion. Xue Pan, caught between loyalties he could not resolve, eventually stood helplessly by, thoroughly exasperated, and left the house in despair. Jin Gui, meanwhile, secretly explained to Baochan that that very night Xue Pan was to be “married” in Qiu Ling’s room – meaning that she was to be forced to accompany him in bed. At first Qiu Ling refused, but Jin Gui insisted that she must not be overly particular about comfort during the dark hours. She scolded, “Have you not seen our master? He hoards his maidservants so no one may approach you – what is your plan? I fear you intend to ruin me!” Worried that this might spoil Baochan’s reputation, Xue Pan quickly returned and admonished Qiu Ling, “If you do not obey, I will beat you!” With no alternative, Qiu Ling had to gather her bedding and lie down on the floor, reluctantly obeying. No sooner had she settled than she was repeatedly summoned for tea throughout the night, and her legs were struck several times so that she could not rest a moment. Xue Pan, having secured Baochan as if he were a treasure, ignored all else. In his bitterness, Jin Gui murmured, “Let him have his fun for a few days; when he grows distant, then I can arrange Xiangling as I wish. Then Baochan, originally mine, will be of no consequence.” Quietly enduring, she schemed to further control Qiu Ling.
Let each go his own way.” Zhou Ruijia replied, “That is exactly what you understand. Tomorrow there will be more people sent; rest assured.” Si Qi, unable to help but weep, kowtowed to Yingchun and bid farewell to everyone. Then she whispered to Yingchun, “Even if you try to plead my case, please at least speak on my behalf—just a small favor.” Yingchun replied tearfully, “Rest assured.” Thus, Zhou Ruijia and his companions took Si Qi away. Two old women then gathered all of Si Qi’s belongings and handed them to her. After only a few steps, they encountered Xiu Ju, who was already wiping away tears. He handed Si Qi a small silk pouch and said, “This is from your sister – a token of our shared bond. Since we must eventually part, take it as a memento.” Si Qi accepted it and burst into further tears, crying together with Xiu Ju. Impatient, Zhou Ruijia urged, and the two finally dispersed. Si Qi, still sobbing, pleaded, “Dear aunts, please show some compassion and let me go, so I may bid farewell to my dearest friend. We have been so close for all these years.” Zhou Ruijia and his companions, each busy with their own tasks, said scornfully, “I advise you to leave; stop dithering! We have important matters to attend to. Who do you think you are, crawling out from your own garment? Why must you say farewell? You’ll only delay for a while—does that matter?” Irritated, he said, “Hurry up and go!” As he spoke, he led her out the back corner gate. Unable to protest further, Si Qi followed. Just then, Bao Yu, returning from outside, saw Si Qi being led away with many belongings. Suspecting that she was being sent off for good, he hurried over and asked, “Where are you going?” Zhou Ruijia and the others, well aware of Bao Yu’s past behavior and fearing that prying might cause further trouble, laughed and said, “None of your business—hurry and study!” Bao Yu, laughing nervously, said, “Sisters, please wait a moment—I have something to say.” Zhou Ruijia retorted, “Madame has ordered that you must not waste any time. What reason could you possibly have? We only know what Madame says and cannot meddle further.” Si Qi, upon seeing Bao Yu, clutched his hand and cried, “What have you done to me? Please, tell me—please, I beg you!” Bao Yu, with tears streaming down his face, said, “I do not know what terrible deed you have committed! Qingwen is so ill, and now you are about to leave—what shall we do?” Growing impatient, Zhou Ruijia said to Si Qi, “If you do not behave as a proper lady, I will beat you. Do not think that your former privileges will save you now! Even if you must be noisy for a short while, that is inevitable!” Before long, several women seized Si Qi and dragged her away. Bao Yu, fearing they might blab everything, glared after them until they were out of sight, muttering bitterly, “How strange—once a woman is married and carries the scent of a man, she becomes so unprincipled, even more so than a man!” An old gatekeeper overheard and asked with a laugh, “So you say that all daughters are virtuous, but every married woman is wicked?” Bao Yu fumed, “Yes, indeed!” Just then, several old women entered and said, “Everyone, be alert and serve properly. At this moment, Madame herself is coming out to inspect the garden.” They then ordered, “Quickly call the people from Yihong Courtyard to meet her at the door and escort her out.” Amused, they added, “Ah, Amitabha! Today, once the heavens open their eyes and send this troublesome imp away, everyone will be at peace.” Bao Yu, upon hearing that Madame Wang was coming for a thorough search, was sure that even Qingwen would not be spared, and hastily fled—but later, as he mumbled his resentful words, he heard nothing further. Later that night at dawn, a little maid from Madame Wang’s room opened the front corner door and announced Madame Wang’s orders: “Immediately rouse Bao Yu; wash your face and change your clothes.
Even if Grandmother forgets, why not have a little gathering here ourselves?” Xiren snapped, “You, you little runt! When we’re speaking properly, you start rambling nonsense again.” Mèiyue retorted, “I’m not just rambling—I’m doing it for your sake.” Xiren demanded, “For my sake? Explain!” Mèiyue replied, “Since Second Master has left for the study, you’re always moping and wishing he’d return so we can chat merrily. Now you’re pretending you’re not involved—why the fuss? I can see it clearly.” Xiren was about to scold him when suddenly someone from Grandmother’s side came to announce, “Grandmother has sent word that Second Master is not required to attend the study tomorrow. She has invited the Mistress over to keep him company, though she fears all the young ladies will come to the house. Shi, Xing, and Li—every one of them has been invited. So what need is there for a Winter Solstice Gathering?” Before Baoyu could finish listening, he grinned and exclaimed, “Isn’t that right? Grandmother is most delighted. Not having to attend classes is certainly a blessing.” Xiren could only remain silent. The maid went off. After diligently studying for a few days, Baoyu longed to enjoy a day of play. Later, when he heard that Mrs. Xue had arrived—thinking that “Baojie” would naturally be there—his heart leapt with joy. “Go to sleep early, and get up soon tomorrow,” he told himself, and that night passed without further word. The next day, as expected, he went early to greet Grandmother. He then proceeded to greet Jia Zheng and Lord Wang; after confirming that Grandmother had indeed dismissed classes today, Jia Zheng said nothing further and slowly withdrew. After a few steps, Baoyu dashed off to Grandmother’s room. There, he found that no one else was present except for the wet nurse from Fengjie’s side, who had come with Clever Sister along with several little maids to pay respects to Grandmother, saying, “My mother sent me to greet you; when she returns she will come again.” Grandmother laughed, “Good child, I awoke early—if they do not come, I shall manage on my own. Only your Second Uncle has come.” The wet nurse then said, “Miss, please greet Uncle for us.” Clever Sister then greeted him. Baoyu also called out, “How’s little Niuniu?” Clever Sister replied, “Last night, my mother said she would ask Second Uncle to speak with you.” Baoyu asked, “About what?” Clever Sister replied, “My mother said that after having studied with Li Ma for several years, she wasn’t sure if I recognized the characters. I said I did—but she accused me of fooling him, claiming I spent all my time playing and couldn’t recognize a thing. She then insisted that Second Uncle should review my work when he has time.” Grandmother laughed, “Good child, your mother can’t read, so she has to rely on you to amuse her. Tomorrow, have your Second Uncle show your work to convince her.” Baoyu then asked, “How many characters have you learned?” Clever Sister replied proudly, “Over three thousand! I have recited a copy of the ‘Classic of Filial Piety for Women’ and, in just half a month, even studied the ‘Biographies of Exemplary Women’.” Baoyu said, “Do you truly understand them? If not, I can explain them to you.” Grandmother interjected, “Your uncle should indeed explain them to his niece.” Baoyu began, “Well, the virtues of Queen Wen and her consorts need not be recounted. And as for Jiang, who was disgraced for his transgression, and the wise yet humble women of Qi who brought stability to the state—they are models among the consorts.” Clever Sister listened and replied with a soft “Yes.” Baoyu continued, “If we speak of talent, then we have figures such as Lady Cao, Ban Jieyu, Cai Wenji, and Xie Daoyun.” Clever Sister inquired, “And what of their moral integrity?” Baoyu said, “Consider the humble cloth skirts of Meng Guang, the water-drawing jars of Bao Xuan’s wife, or the hair-cutting customs of Tao Kan’s mother—these examples of unsullied virtue.” Clever Sister nodded in understanding.
Step by step, she trudged along slowly. After walking for a long while, she had not yet reached the banks of Qinfang Bridge. For her steps were feeble and her mind muddled, and she inadvertently wandered off the proper path, extending her journey by several more paces. At length, she arrived at the edge of Qinfang Bridge—but then, as if unconsciously drawn back along the embankment, she began to retrace her steps. Zizhuan, having fetched the handkerchief, looked about and did not see Daiyu. While searching, she spied a figure with a pallid, ashen face—Daiyu, staggering slightly, turning this way and that. Then, from a distance, another maid was seen moving ahead, though too far away to be clearly identified. Alarmed and uncertain, Zizhuan hurried over and softly asked, “Miss, where are you headed? Are you going somewhere?” In her confused state, Daiyu murmured, “I… I’m going to ask Baoyu.” Zizhuan, perplexed, helped steady her and led her back toward Jia Mu’s courtyard. When Daiyu reached the gate of Jia Mu’s residence, she suddenly felt a moment of clarity. Glancing back, she saw Zizhuan supporting her and asked, “What are you doing here?” Zizhuan offered a weak smile, “I brought your handkerchief. Earlier I saw you by the bridge and hurried over to ask, but you wouldn’t answer.” Daiyu smiled faintly, “I thought you’d come to see Second Master Baoyu; otherwise, why would you be heading this way?” Realizing that Daiyu had evidently overheard the maid’s words, Zizhuan only nodded with a faint smile. Yet inside, she was gripped by anxiety—if Baoyu, already in a state of madness, were to hear such disjointed words from someone as confused as Daiyu, what would become of him? Though troubled by these thoughts, she dared not intervene and instead supported Daiyu inside. Now, Daiyu herself was no longer as feeble as before; she did not need Zizhuan to draw aside the curtain—she lifted it herself and entered the room. There, she saw Baoyu sitting; he did not rise to greet her but merely smiled in a foolish manner. Daiyu took a seat, watching Baoyu’s silly smile as he simply nodded back. Neither spoke greetings nor exchanged words—the two just sat there, grinning vacantly at each other. Xiren, witnessing this scene, felt utterly at a loss for what to do, though she dared not intervene. Suddenly, Daiyu spoke softly, “Baoyu, why are you so ill?” Baoyu only smiled and replied, “I am ill for Miss Lin.” Both Xiren and Zizhuan were struck mute with shock, and they quickly attempted to change the subject. Yet neither would speak; they simply continued to smile foolishly. Seeing this, Xiren recognized that Daiyu was as confused as Baoyu—lost in her thoughts. Quietly, she leaned toward Zizhuan and murmured, “Miss, you seem fine now. I’ll have little Qiu Wen help you escort her so she can rest.” Turning to Qiu Wen, she added, “You and Zizhuan, please see that Miss Lin is taken away—do not let her say another word.” Qiu Wen smiled silently and helped lift Daiyu. Daiyu then stood, glancing at Baoyu and only smiling and nodding. Zizhuan urged, “Miss, let’s go home and rest.” Daiyu agreed, “Yes, it’s time to return.” As she turned to leave, she walked out laughing and, unusually, without any assistance from the maids—yet she moved much faster than usual. Zizhuan and Qiu Wen hurried to follow her. Outside the gate of Jia Mu’s residence, Daiyu kept walking straight ahead until Zizhuan quickly called, “Amitābha—are we home?” Before she could finish, Daiyu’s legs gave out; with a sudden cry, she fell forward and spat out a mouthful of blood. What fate awaits her? We shall have to wait and see in the next installment.
In her fury she ordered, “Sell Xiangling immediately!” Miss Bao then laughed, “Our family only knows how to buy people, not sell them – madam, you are in a state of confusion. If word gets out, won’t it be a laughingstock? If my elder brother and sister-in-law despise her and leave her to me, then I am doomed!” Aunt Xue replied, “Better to dismiss her completely than leave her with us.” Miss Bao laughed, “Whether she stays with me or not, it matters not—cut her off as if she were sold.” Xiangling had already run up to Aunt Xue, crying bitterly and pleading not to be dismissed; she wished instead to remain with the young lady. Aunt Xue, with no alternative, had to relent. After that, Xiangling indeed left with Miss Bao, effectively severing the old ties. Yet she could not help but feel sorrow under the moonlight, and by lamplight she lamented softly. Though she had spent several years in Xue Pan’s household, her delicate constitution – marred by her inherited illness – meant she never conceived; now, aggravated by anger and emotional strain, her health deteriorated further, and she gradually developed a “dry blood” syndrome, growing thinner and losing her appetite, with no effective remedy. Meanwhile, Jin Gui’s quarrels with Xue Pan grew more frequent. On some occasions, bolstered by wine, Xue Pan even confronted her twice. When he attempted to strike with a stick, Jin Gui dodged and ordered him away. When he nearly drew a knife to kill, she stretched out her neck in defiance. Xue Pan, unable to bring himself to hit her, raged for a while before giving up. Over time, this became habitual, and it even led Jin Gui to increasingly insult Baochan. Baochan, who could not compare with Xiangling, was like dry tinder; having bonded with Xue Pan over shared feelings, he completely disregarded Jin Gui. Outraged by Jin Gui’s continual mistreatment, Baochan refused to back down. At first there were quarrels and shoving; later Jin Gui’s anger escalated to insults, and then even to physical blows. Though Baochan dared not fight back, he began to roll and flail about as if seeking death, both by day with knives and scissors, and by night with ropes – causing endless havoc. Xue Pan, caught between conflicting loyalties, stood helplessly by, thoroughly exasperated, and eventually left the house in despair. Jin Gui, meanwhile, secretly explained to Baochan that that very night Xue Pan was to “marry” in Qiu Ling’s room – that is, she was to be made to accompany Jin Gui in bed. At first Qiu Ling refused, but Jin Gui insisted, claiming that she was being too fastidious and that comfort was secondary to convenience in the dark of night. She scolded, “Have you not seen our master? He takes every opportunity to hoard his maidservants and won’t let you near – what is your plan? I fear you intend to drive me to ruin!” Xue Pan, fearing that this might ruin Baochan’s reputation, quickly returned and admonished Qiu Ling, “If you do not obey, I will beat you!” Qiu Ling, with no choice, had to gather her bedding and lie down on the floor, reluctantly obeying. No sooner had she laid down than she was summoned repeatedly for tea throughout the night, and her legs were pounded several times so that she could not rest for a moment. Xue Pan, having secured Baochan as if it were a treasure, ignored all else. In his bitterness, Jin Gui murmured, “Let him have his fun for a few days; once he grows distant, then I can arrange for Xiangling. Then Baochan, originally mine, will be useless.” Quietly enduring, she schemed to further manipulate Qiu Ling. After about half a month, Qiu Ling suddenly pretended to be ill, complaining of unbearable heartache and immobility with treatments proving ineffective. Everyone remarked that it was due to her suppressed anger. After two days, unexpectedly, someone discovered a paper effigy hidden among Jin Gui’s pillows – bearing her age and an inscription of eight characters, with five needles pinned into her heart area and the gaps between her ribs and limbs. Thus the household took this as news and reported it first to Aunt Xue. Aunt Xue, now frantic, and Xue Pan, even more disordered, threatened to interrogate everyone. Jin Gui said, “There is no need to wrong innocent people.
I have recited a copy of the ‘Classic of Filial Piety for Women’ and, in just half a month, even studied the ‘Biographies of Exemplary Women’.” Baoyu said, “Do you truly understand them? If not, I can explain them to you.” Grandmother interjected, “Your uncle should indeed explain them to his niece.” Baoyu began, “Well, the virtues of Queen Wen and her consorts need not be recounted. And as for Jiang, who was disgraced for his transgression, and the wise yet humble women of Qi who brought stability to the state—they are models among the consorts.” Clever Sister listened and replied with a soft “Yes.” Baoyu continued, “If we speak of talent, then we have figures such as Lady Cao, Ban Jieyu, Cai Wenji, and Xie Daoyun.” Clever Sister inquired, “And what of their moral integrity?” Baoyu said, “Consider the humble cloth skirts of Meng Guang, the water-drawing jars of Bao Xuan’s wife, or the hair-cutting customs of Tao Kan’s mother—these examples of unsullied virtue.” Clever Sister nodded in understanding. Baoyu went on, “There are also the tragic—like the shattered mirror of Lechang and Su Hui’s lament; the filial—such as Mulan’s substitution for her father in war, or Cao E’s desperate plunge into water to retrieve a body—and many more that I cannot fully recount.” At these words, Clever Sister fell silent, appearing deep in thought. Fearing that his words might embarrass her, Baoyu added hastily, “And those who are renowned for their beauty—like Wang Qiang, Xi Zi, Fan Su, Xiao Man, Jiangxian, Wenjun, and Hongfu—are among the distinguished…” Before he could finish, Grandmother observed Clever Sister’s quietude and said, “That is enough—there is no need to go on; too many words will be forgotten.” Clever Sister replied, “Second Uncle did speak of them. Some I have memorized, others not. Those I have learned, I know all their virtues.” Baoyu then said, “The characters come naturally to those who study; no need for further explanation.” Clever Sister then mentioned, “I also heard my mother say that our little Red was originally from Second Uncle’s family, and that my mother has yet to repair her clothing. She’s considering whether to have someone mend the piece from the Liu family for me—though she’s not sure if Second Uncle agrees.” Baoyu beamed with delight and said, “Listen to your mother! If she wants it mended, then have it mended—why question it?” He then grinned at Grandmother, “I think young Niuniu, with his little face and clever mind, might one day surpass even Fengjie in learning.” Grandmother replied, “A girl’s ability to learn is commendable, but what truly matters is her skill in needlework and embroidery.” Clever Sister agreed, “I am also learning from Aunt Liu. Although I may not be perfect at flower-stitching or tassel work, I’ve managed a few stitches.” Grandmother said, “For families like ours, it is not enough to rely solely on our own efforts—we must at least know a thing or two so that later we are not at the mercy of others.” Clever Sister nodded, and then asked Baoyu to explain the ‘Biographies of Exemplary Women.’ Baoyu, looking slightly puzzled, explained, “What do you mean by ‘looking dazed’?” He continued, “It is simply that when Liu’s Fifth is admitted into Yi Hong Courtyard—first when he was ill and could not come in, and then when Madam Wang expelled Qingwen—anyone with beauty dares not choose him. Later, when I saw Qingwen at the Wu Family’s, and Fifth accompanied his mother to deliver something to her, I found him even more charming. Today, thanks to Fengjie’s thoughtfulness, he has been allowed to join the ranks of Little Red’s group—and I am overjoyed.” This left Baoyu staring off dreamily. Meanwhile, Grandmother’s household gathered. Grandmother Jia, Madam Wang, Li Wan, and others were present.
He heard one person remark, “Look, is he coming up or not?” in a tone reminiscent of Li Wen’s speech. Another laughed, “Good—he’s coming down; I know he won’t come up.” That voice was none other than Tan Chun’s. Then another said, “Yes, she is coming up.” These last two were the voices of Li Qi and Xing Xiuyan. Unable to resist, Bao Yu picked up a small brick and threw it into the water with a splash. The sound startled all four, and they exclaimed, “Who threw that so suddenly? That nearly scared us to death!” Bao Yu leaped out from behind the rockery with a laugh and called, “You all are so amusing! Why didn’t you call out to me?” Tan Chun said, “I knew it wasn’t anyone else—it must be our second elder brother being mischievous. There’s nothing to say; just compensate us for our lost fish. Earlier, a fish came up; it was about to be caught, but you scared it away.” Bao Yu laughed, “Since you’re playing here and didn’t call for me, now I must punish you!” Everyone laughed. Bao Yu then declared, “Let us fish today and see whose luck is best! Whoever catches a fish, their fortune is good this year; if not, then their luck is poor. Who shall cast first?” Tan Chun suggested, “Let Li Wen go first,” but Li Wen refused. Tan Chun laughed, “Then I shall cast first,” and turned to Bao Yu, “Second master, if you drive away my fish, I shall not abide it.” Bao Yu replied, “I intended only to startle you all for fun; now go ahead and fish.” Tan Chun cast the line, and in a few moments a small fish swallowed the hook along with the bobber. Tan Chun lifted his rod from the ground—so lively! An attendant scrambled across, gathering the fish and placing them in a small porcelain basin filled with clear water. Tan Chun then handed the rod to Li Wen. Li Wen cast his line, but when he felt the string move, he quickly reeled it in—only to find it empty. After trying again for a while, the line moved, and he reeled it in once more—still an empty hook. Inspecting the hook, Li Wen discovered he had indeed caught something. Laughing, he said, “Brother Bao, you have caught something.” Bao Yu said, “Then let Third Sister and Fourth Sister fish, and I will fish later.” Xiuyan remained silent. Soon Li Qi said, “Brother Bao, you fish first.” As a bobber emerged from the water, Tan Chun remarked, “There’s no need to yield completely. Look, the fish are gathered near Third Sister’s area—let her fish quickly.” Li Qi then took the rod and, as soon as it sank, caught a fish. Then Xiuyan fished and caught one, and soon passed the rod to Tan Chun, who then handed it to Bao Yu. Bao Yu declared, “I wish to be like Jiang Taigong,” and proceeded to sit by the pond on a rock outcrop and began fishing. But the fish, upon seeing him, scattered away, and Bao Yu swung his rod for a long time—the line remaining motionless. When a fish eventually surfaced, Bao Yu waggled his rod and scared it off. Frustrated, he said, “I am naturally impatient, yet he is slow—what shall I do? Come on, good fish, do me a favor!” which made all four laugh. Before long, the fishing line stirred slightly. Overjoyed, Bao Yu mustered his strength, scooped up the line, but when his rod struck a rock it broke in two, the line snapping and the hook disappearing. Everyone laughed even harder. Tan Chun said, “I’ve never seen anyone as clumsy as you!”  Just then, Mosyue rushed in in a panic and said, “Second master, Grandmother has awakened—she’s calling for you!” All five were startled. Tan Chun then asked Mosyue, “What does Grandmother want?” Mosyue replied, “I don’t know.
He resolved then to remain at home for a couple of days to recuperate, for fear of being sought out by others if he went out. Meanwhile, those who had long been allied with Xue Pan in high spirits—seeing that no one was present at the Xue household except for the young and inexperienced Xue Ke—began to covet his position. Some schemed to insert themselves as errand runners; others, capable of serving as assistants or scribes, hoped to manage his affairs; still others planned to extort money from him; and some even spread fearful rumors. Xue Ke, noticing these people from afar, did his best to avoid them, yet he dared not confront them directly for fear of provoking unexpected consequences. Instead, he stayed hidden at home, waiting for events to unfold—details he would not mention further. That very night, Jin Gui had sent Baocan some wine and fruit to “probe” Xue Ke’s situation, and Baocan returned with a full report of Xue Ke’s condition. When Jin Gui found that the matter did not go exactly as he had hoped, he feared that the fuss might backfire and that Baocan would look down on him. Desperate to cover his tracks, he tried to deflect with a few evasive remarks, but found himself unable to extricate the matter. Lost in thought and sitting in silence, he had no clear plan. Meanwhile, Baocan—knowing that Xue Pan was unlikely to return home soon and wishing to avoid Jin Gui’s scrutiny—kept his own counsel. Yet seeing that Jin Gui’s actions had already set events in motion, Baocan, eager to seize the advantage, decided to turn the tables and maneuver Xue Ke into a compromising position, hoping that if Xue Ke repented, he might easily be subdued. But when Xue Ke showed no overt interest and behaved reservedly, Baocan hesitated to act. Later, when Xue Ke was seen blowing out his lamp and falling asleep, Baocan returned to report to Jin Gui, who then planned his next move. Jin Gui, having not slept well all night, was at a loss for what to do; he resolved to wait until the next morning. At dawn, he planned to retrieve his belongings and, while changing into one or two sets of delicately colored garments without washing his hair—thus displaying a languid, coquettish air—he would feign anger and simply ignore Xue Ke. His idea was that if Xue Ke showed any sign of remorse, he would naturally withdraw, leaving Jin Gui’s plan intact. When, in the morning, Jin Gui encountered Xue Ke, who still appeared as he had the previous night with no sign of debauchery, Jin Gui deliberately returned with a dish, leaving behind the wine jug as a pretext for further intrigue. At that moment, Jin Gui asked, “Did you go with your things? Did anyone see you?” Baocan replied, “No.” Jin Gui pressed further, “And did Second Master ask you anything?” Baocan replied, “Not at all.” Jin Gui, having not slept through the night and at a loss for strategy, mused, “If I were to carry out such a scheme, others might be fooled—but how can Baocan keep it secret? Perhaps I should offer him a share so that he will have nothing to complain about. Besides, I cannot act on my own; I must rely on him to execute the plan. Let us agree on a secure course of action.” With a wry smile, Jin Gui continued, “Tell me, what sort of man is Second Master Xue Ke, really?” Baocan shrugged and said, “He appears rather foolish.” Jin Gui laughed, “You’re starting to act as if you’ve had your share of men! No wonder our elder brother could not do without you at home.” Baocan merely sneered and replied, “It is his failure to heed our Mistress’s wishes that I speak of.” Jin Gui demanded, “How has he failed my heart?” Baocan replied, “Our Mistress offers him the best food, yet he refuses to partake. Is that not a betrayal of her goodwill?” He winked conspiratorially at Jin Gui. Jin Gui scolded, “Don’t let your tongue run wild. I don’t understand your meaning.” Baocan laughed, “Don’t worry, Mistress, I have but one heart—no more to give. But these matters must be kept secret; if word gets out, it will all be for naught.” Jin Gui’s face flushed as he replied, “You, you little runt—you’re no good!
A new prescription for “Regulating and Nourishing the Menstrual and Vitality Pills” was drawn up. For this formula, two taels of the finest ginseng were required. However, when Madame Wang searched for it, she spent half a day only to find, in a small box, a few strands of ginseng no thicker than hairpins. Displeased, she ordered that they search further; soon they retrieved a large bundle of what appeared to be coarse “musty” bits. Frustrated, Madame Wang exclaimed, “It isn’t necessary to have it in such abundance—but if you use it, you must be able to find more! I keep asking you all to gather it in one place, but you never listen and just casually toss it aside.” Cai Yun replied, “I’m afraid that’s all there is. Last time the other madame came and took what was available.” Madame Wang said, “If that is so, then look carefully once again.” Cai Yun went off searching again and returned with several more bundles of medicinal material. “We do not recognize this variety,” she said, “so please, madame, inspect it for yourself. Apart from this, there is nothing else.” Opening the packages, Madame Wang found that she could not identify them at all – not a single strand of genuine ginseng was found. At once, she sent someone to ask Miss Feng if she had any. Miss Feng replied, “There are only a few ginseng extracts. Although there are a few strands of reed-root mustache, they are not of the finest quality and are needed daily for the decoction.” Hearing this, Madame Wang then inquired with Mrs. Xing, saying, “Because we ran out last time, I came here to look; it appears they have all been used up.” Having no alternative, Madame Wang resolved to personally ask Grandmother Jia. Grandmother Jia immediately ordered Yuan Yang to bring out the remaining supplies from that very day – and lo, there was a large bundle still kept, with pieces of varying thickness; she weighed out two taels and handed them over to Madame Wang. Madame Wang then sent them with Zhou Ruijia’s servant to the physician’s house. She also ordered that the remaining unidentified packets be taken along so the doctor could inspect them and label each package accordingly. Before long, Zhou Ruijia returned and said, “All these packets have now been labeled. However, that one packet of ginseng, though excellent, is far too old. No matter how well it may have been preserved, after a hundred years it turns to ash. And though this batch has not yet crumbled to ash, it has become rotten and withered—devoid of strength. Please, madame, discard these; it matters not if the pieces are thick or thin, you must exchange them for fresh ones.” Hearing this, Madame Wang lowered her head in silence for a long while before saying, “There is no other way; we must go and buy two taels of new ginseng.” Unwilling to pay further attention to the matter, she commanded, “Gather everything up.” Then she instructed Zhou Ruijia, “Go and tell those outside to select the best and exchange them for two taels. And if, by any chance, Grandmother inquires, just say that these are Grandmother’s supplies – do not mention more.” Just then, as Zhou Ruijia was about to depart, Miss Bao, who had been seated, laughed and said, “Madame, hold on a moment. Nowadays none of the ginseng available is good. Even if one finds whole stems, they are always cut into two or three pieces, mounted with reed mustache and mixed with other materials to be marketable—they look rough. In our shop we often trade with the merchants; I have spoken to Mother already, and Brother will send a fellow over to request two taels of original ginseng stems from the traders. Perhaps we should be willing to pay a bit more silver so that we may finally secure a good batch.” Madame Wang smiled, “Indeed, you understand well. But you must personally go over and see for yourself.” So Miss Bao went, and after a while returned saying, “I have sent someone; by tonight we should have a reply. Tomorrow morning, we may proceed with the order.” Madame Wang, delighted, said, “‘The oil-selling maid combs her hair with water.’ In our household there is always enough to give to others – yet now when it comes to our own use, we find ourselves scrambling about to find it.” With a long sigh, she added.
I asked them, ‘How can you be so sure?’ They replied, ‘A few years ago in January, a fortune-teller from another province came and made a very accurate prediction. The old lady had our younger sisters’ birth charts placed alongside Princess Yuan’s, and when he calculated, he said, ‘The girl born on the first day of the first lunar month—if the birth time is mistaken, then though she may be a noble, she cannot thrive in this household.’ Regardless of whether he was right, our master insisted on following his calculation. The fortune-teller then said, ‘In the year of Jia-Shen and on a Bing-Yin day, there are the elements of “Hurting Officer” and “Defeated Wealth.” But in the character for “Shen” there are also “Proper Officer” and “Salary Horse” symbols—this indicates a household that cannot keep her, and no good is to be expected. The day is Yi-Mao, in early spring when wood is flourishing. Though it shows the sign of “Peer,” it is said that the more one is “peer,” the worse it is—like fine timber that, if overworked, will never become a great material.’ Then he rejoiced at the appearance of Xin-Jin as the favorable element, and praised the unique prominence of “Proper Officer” and “Salary Horse” in the Si hour: this is known as the ‘Flying Luck Horse Pattern.’ He also mentioned that when one’s day is graced by ‘Exclusive Luck,’ one is extremely esteemed. ‘The Two Virtues of the Heavenly Moon’ presiding over one’s destiny ensure one receives the favor of the imperial harem. This young lady, if her birth time is correct, is destined to become a mistress of high standing. Isn’t that an accurate prediction? We still recall the saying, ‘Alas, glory is short-lived; one only fears that when the year of Yin meets the month of Mao, it will be like endless rivals, a constant struggle—as with fine timber, if it is too delicately carved, it loses its substance.’ They completely forgot all these details and only busied themselves with trivial matters. I then recalled and asked, ‘Tell our eldest lady, isn’t this year the year of Yin and the month of Mao?’” Before Baochai could finish recounting these words, Xue Ke hastily interrupted, “Let’s not concern ourselves with other people’s affairs. Since we have this accurate fortune-teller, I wonder what ill-star that has befallen our brother this year to cause such misfortune? Quickly, cast our brother’s birth chart—I will have it calculated to see if any inauspicious influences are at work.” Baochai replied, “He is from another province; I’m not sure if he is still in the capital this year.” With that, she arranged for Madam Xue to proceed to the Jia mansion. Once there, only Li Wan, Tan-chun, and a few others were at home. They asked, “How is our eldest uncle’s matter coming along?” Madam Xue explained, “We are awaiting further orders from our superiors; it seems that a death sentence is unlikely.” This news finally put everyone at ease. Tan-chun then said, “Last night the mistress remarked, ‘Last time, when there was trouble at home, we relied entirely on the Concubine to see things through; now that we have troubles of our own, it is equally hard to manage.’ It seems her mind is troubled.” Madam Xue replied, “I too am deeply grieved at home. But since your eldest brother has suffered this misfortune, and your two other brothers are off handling official matters, what use is your elder sister left alone? Moreover, our daughter-in-law is rather naive and cannot extricate herself from the situation. And now, the county magistrate is busy preparing for Consort Zhou’s memorial assignment, so the case remains unresolved. That is why your two brothers have returned, and I came over to see for myself.” Li Wan then said, “Madam, why don’t you stay with us for a few days? It would be better.” Madam Xue nodded, “I shall remain here to keep you sisters company—only, Bao, you must try to remain calm.” Xi-chun remarked, “Madam, since you’re so concerned, why don’t you also invite Bao, our elder sister, to stay?” Madam Xue smiled and said, “I can’t do that.” Xi-chun pressed, “Why not?
When she got married, she took all the family property with her. Now that your second aunt has also married out, her household is in dire straits. And your third aunt still remains at home; all household expenses are managed by the Wang Shambao household. I only came to ask for a few taels of silver, not to claim the family’s property – even my Xing family’s property is enough for my needs. But alas, I couldn’t get hold of any, so you all end up calling me broke!” Seeing him drunk, Jia Zhen quickly interjected with soothing words. Outside, Lady You and the others, having heard everything clearly, whispered to Silver Butterfly and the others, “Listen – this is the brother of the Mistress of the North Courtyard complaining. Clearly, even his own brothers are like this, so it is no wonder these people behave as they do.” While they were still listening, the people playing the “Driving Old Goats” game had also paused for a drink. One person then asked, “Who offended Uncle too? We didn’t catch it. Please, tell us, so we can judge.” Xing Dequan then repeated what the two serving children had said without interference. Taking it from him, one man said, “It’s infuriating – Uncle was right to be angry. I ask you, Uncle only lost a few taels of silver, nothing more—so why do you all ignore him?” Everyone burst into laughter. Xing Dequan also sputtered a mouthful of food and said, “You really are such a useless fellow—if you can’t even move, you resort to causing mischief.” Lady You, standing outside, listened and spat a quiet curse, “Listen to this shameless little scoundrel! After drowning himself in cheap liquor, what new tricks will he come up with next?” And with that, she went back inside to remove her makeup and rest. At the fourth watch, Jia Zhen finally dispersed and went to the Pei Feng Room. The next day, someone announced, “The watermelons and mooncakes are all prepared; we just need to divide and deliver them.” Jia Zhen then ordered Pei Feng, “Please see that Granny gets them delivered; I have other matters to attend to.” Pei Feng agreed, returned to Lady You, and distributed them one by one, dispatching people to deliver them. Soon Pei Feng said, “The master asks: Will Granny go out today or not? Since we are a family of filial piety, we cannot break the tradition on the fifteenth, and tonight it is just right for everyone to respond to the scene.” Lady You replied, “I really don’t wish to go out. Over there, Granny Zhu is ill again and Second Madam Lian is in bed; if I do not go, there will be even fewer people.” Pei Feng said, “The master says that even if Granny goes out, she should return early, and ask me to accompany her.” Lady You replied, “In that case, eat quickly so I can depart.” Pei Feng said, “The master said breakfast is to be eaten outside; please, Granny, eat on your own.” Lady You asked, “Who is out there today?” Pei Feng replied, “I hear there are two newcomers from Nanjing, though I don’t know who they are.” After that, they ate, changed clothes, and Lady You and the others returned to the Rong Mansion, not coming back until late. Sure enough, Jia Zhen cooked a pork dish and a whole portion of lamb, preparing a table full of vegetables, fruits, and assorted delicacies. In the Huifang Garden’s Conglü Tang, he led his wives and concubines to dine first, then laid out wine and feasted merrily under the moon. Around the first watch of the night, the sky was clear and the moon radiant, with the Milky Way faintly hidden. Jia Zhen then ordered Pei Feng and three others to join him at the table, where a row of attendants sat below, playing guessing games with coins. After a while, Jia Zhen, having drunk a bit too much and feeling cheerful, ordered a purple bamboo flute to be fetched, instructing Pei Feng to play it while the musicians and singers performed. The clear, graceful tones were deeply moving. After the performance, the order was resumed. By the time it was nearly the third watch, Jia Zhen’s alcohol level reached about eighty percent.
What other verses have you composed?” Daiyu asked, “How did you hear that?” Baoyu said, “I heard it the other day as I passed Liao Feng Pavilion, but I was afraid to break your serene melody, so I listened quietly for a while and then left. I intended to ask you—your verses begin in a level tone, but toward the end they shift to a slanted tone. What does that mean?” Daiyu replied, “It is simply the natural expression of the human heart; the music flows as it must, with no fixed form.” Baoyu said, “I see. Alas, I do not possess the refined sensitivity to truly appreciate it—I only listened for a while in vain.” Daiyu sighed, “Throughout the ages, how few kindred spirits have there been!” Baoyu, realizing he might have spoken too boldly and fearing he might wound Daiyu’s fragile heart further, fell silent. They sat together in quiet contemplation; though Baoyu’s heart brimmed with unsaid thoughts, there was nothing more he could express. Seizing the moment, Daiyu said, “Let me ask you a question: How would you answer if I inquired—what do you do when Baochai is with you? What do you do if Baochai is not with you? What did you do when Baochai was with you the other day, and what will you do when she is not? If you are with her and then she is not, what do you do? And if you are with her today but not tomorrow, what then? If you are with her and she refuses to be with you, what will you do?” Baoyu sat with his legs crossed, folded his hands, closed his eyes, and pursed his lips, and after a long silence suddenly burst into laughter, “No matter how vast the Weak Waters may be, I would take only a single ladle’s worth.” Daiyu pressed, “But how does the ladle float on water?” Baoyu replied, “It is not the ladle that floats—it is the water that flows, and the ladle merely drifts along.” Daiyu queried, “And if the water stops, and the pearls sink—what then?” Baoyu answered, “Once the Zen mind is sullied by the mud of attachment, it matters not if the spring breeze causes a partridge to dance.” Daiyu remarked, “The first precept of the Zen Path is not to spout false words.” Baoyu said, “It is like the Three Treasures.” Daiyu lowered her head in silence. Outside, the crows on the eaves cawed a few times before flying off toward the southeast. Baoyu asked, “I wonder, what fate does this portend?” Daiyu replied, “‘The auspicious and inauspicious of a man are not revealed by the calls of birds.’” Just then, Qiu Wen entered and said, “Please, Second Master, return. The Master has sent someone to the garden to ask if you have returned from the study. Sister Xiren said, ‘He has returned.’ Now, hurry back!” Startled, Baoyu leapt up and rushed out, and Daiyu dared not detain him. Chapter 92: Evaluating Heroines and the Clever Sister’s Admiration for Virtue, While Jia Zheng Ponders the Comings and Goings Amid “Mother Pearl” Play  Baoyu emerged from the Xiaoxiang Hall and immediately asked Qiu Wen, “What did the Master instruct me to do?” Qiu Wen laughed and replied, “Nothing at all. Sister Xiren asked me to fetch Second Master, for fear you might not come—so I coaxed you along.” Hearing this, Baoyu’s heart eased. “If you’re inviting me, why trouble yourself to frighten me?” he said with a smile, and he returned to the Yi Hong Courtyard. Soon after, Xiren asked, “Where on earth have you been for so long?” Baoyu replied, “I was at Lin’s place. We began discussing matters concerning my ‘Baojie’ at the Xue household, and I ended up sitting there for a while.” Xiren then inquired, “What did you talk about?” Baoyu recounted a passage of Zen-like words he had blurted out. Xiren scolded lightly, “You never stick to common family chatter or recite a few proper poems for conversation—why must you always slip into Zen talk?
At that moment, Feng Xifeng and Ping’er discussed those suspected of spreading rumors. “Could it be that even Yuanyang is involved?” they murmured. Suddenly, someone announced, “The Mistress has arrived!”  Feng Xifeng was startled and, uncertain of what was happening, quickly went out with Ping’er to greet her. Meanwhile, Wang Furen’s expression grew even sterner; she entered accompanied by a single maid and, without a word, went into the inner chambers. Feng Xifeng quickly offered her tea and, forcing a smile, asked, “Madam, are you well today? Have you come for a stroll?”  Wang Furen curtly commanded, “Ping’er, go out!”  Startled, Ping’er immediately replied and led several young maids outside, standing by the door as it was securely closed. Then she herself sat on the steps, ensuring that no one could re-enter. Observing all this, Feng Xifeng grew anxious and asked, “Madam, what is the matter?”  Wang Furen, tears in her eyes, retrieved a perfumed sachet from her sleeve and threw it out, exclaiming, “Look here!”  Feng Xifeng quickly picked it up—it was a richly embroidered, multi‑colored “Spring Joy” sachet. Shocked, she asked, “Madam, where did you get this?”  Wang Furen, trembling and weeping, replied, “Where did I get it? I was sitting by the well—and I thought you were as attentive as I am! But it appears that in broad daylight this very item was found by one of Grandmother’s maids on a rock in the garden. Before long it would have been delivered to Grandmother. Tell me, how did it come to be here?”  Feng Xifeng, now even more agitated, asked, “Madam, how can you be sure it is mine?”  Wang Furen, still crying and lamenting, said, “How can I tell? Which other woman in our household would dare possess such an item? It is said that if a young lady is seen with it, even the servants would notice. If any maid were to find it and spread the word, our reputation would be ruined!”  Deeply embarrassed, Feng Xifeng knelt at the steps and, through tears, confessed, “Madam, I never meant for this to happen. That very sachet was a replica made outside—the tassels and all were bought on the market. Though I am young and do not consider myself haughty, I would never display such an item openly. Even if I did possess one, I would keep it hidden away in private; I could never wear it in public. Besides, if it were to appear in our garden where all our sisters mingle, not only would they see it, but so would the servants—and our reputation would be at risk.”  Wang Furen’s eyes filled with tears. She called for Feng Xifeng to rise, and soon after Jia Lian entered. After a few exchanges, Feng Xifeng confided that she needed to borrow silver for a matter concerning “Liu Jin Feng.” Jia Lian grinned and said, “Pray tell, what is the matter?”  Feng Xifeng explained that earlier someone had accused Liu Er Xifu and her sister of colluding during their gambling sessions—alleging that whatever the younger sister did was directed by her partner. “I thought you, who always advise me, would counsel that one matter is better than two, so that I might preserve my strength. But I did not heed, and now I have incurred the Mistress’s displeasure—and, on top of that, caught an illness. I see no recourse except to let them continue their mischief; after all, there are many others. I have wasted my heart in vain, only to incur the curse of thousands; better that I focus on nursing myself back to health. When I recover, I shall conduct myself with propriety and joy, leaving all disputes for others to settle.”  Ping’er laughed and said, “Madam, you truly are one of a kind—such is our destiny indeed.”  Before long, Jia Lian entered again, clapping his hands and sighing, “Trouble has arisen again! The other day, while I was with Yuanyang, how did the Mistress learn of it? Earlier, she ordered me not to lend two hundred taels for the Mid‑Autumn Festival; I couldn’t borrow them anywhere.
“Who gave you the name ‘Xiangling’?” he demanded. Xiangling replied, “It was given by the girl herself.” Jin Gui scoffed, “Everyone says the girl is cultured, yet her name is not refined at all.” Xiangling quickly laughed, “If madam were to say that my name is unrefined, then she must not have understood my taste. In fact, her learning was even praised by our great-uncle in days past.” (What exactly Xiangling said next will be revealed in the next installment.) Chapter 80: When Beautiful Xiangling Must Suffer the Whip of a Greedy Husband, and When a Daoist’s Nonsensical Rants Incite a Jealous Wife  After the learned discussion had ended, Jin Gui (Golden Laurel) listened and, twisting her neck, pursed her lips, and snorted through her nostrils, coldly laughing: “Xiang – as in the blooming of water caltrops – who ever remarked that fragrance comes from them? If water caltrops were truly fragrant, then what use would there be for ordinary fragrant flowers? They are utterly out of place!”  Xiangling replied, “It isn’t only that water caltrops emit a delicate scent; even lotus leaves and seedpods possess a similar subtle fragrance. But they are not meant to be compared with the aroma of flowers. When one pays close attention – whether in the quiet of day or in the stillness of midnight – that gentle fragrance is even more pleasing than that of any flower. Even water caltrops, chicken heads, reed leaves, and rush roots, when caressed by the wind and dew, exude a refreshing scent that uplifts one’s spirit.”  Jin Gui retorted, “According to you, then, what of the fragrance of orchids and osmanthus? Are they not pleasing?”  At the height of the conversation, one of Jin Gui’s maidservants – named Baochan – suddenly pointed at Xiangling’s face and exclaimed, “You’ll be in deep trouble! How dare you utter the name of the girl?”  Startled, Xiangling immediately realized her mistake. Blushing, she hastily smiled and said, “I merely let my tongue run away with me; please, madam, do not hold it against me.”  Jin Gui laughed and said, “That is nothing—but you must be extra cautious. I think the character ‘香’ (‘fragrance’) is not quite appropriate; it should be replaced by another character. Do you agree?”  Xiangling smiled, “Madam, you speak truly. At this moment, every part of me belongs to you; how can I then be asked whether I approve of a change of name? If you say that a certain character is good, then let it be used.”  Jin Gui coldly laughed, “You may say so, but I fear you might take it to heart.”  Xiangling replied with a gentle smile, “Madam, when you bought me, it was at the direction of our old matriarch – thus the name was given. Later, when I entered service with the master, it no longer mattered to me. Now that you are here again, it is even less connected to me. Moreover, I am a sensible person – why should I be troubled by such things?”  Jin Gui mused, “In that case, the character ‘香’ is not as suitable as the character ‘秋’ (‘autumn’). After all, water caltrops and their flowers flourish in autumn. Wouldn’t ‘秋’ carry a more fitting origin?”  Xiangling smiled and agreed, “Very well, madam, let it be so.” From that point on the character was changed from “香” to “秋.” Miss Bao, however, did not seem to mind the change. Meanwhile, Xue Pan (a man of hot-blooded ambition) – true to his nature, ever desiring to conquer greater heights – having married Jin Gui, now found that her maid Baochan possessed a certain coquettish charm and a playfully flirtatious manner; she would deliberately request tea and water in a teasing way. Although Baochan understood what was expected, she was afraid of Jin Gui and dared not act too boldly, watching carefully for the look in her mistress’s eyes.
Come, have a bowl.” After saying this, she immediately sent someone to prepare the tea. Lady You stood silent, lost in thought. One of the maidservants then inquired, “Granny, you haven’t washed your face yet at noon—would you like to freshen up now?” Lady You nodded. Miss Li quickly ordered Su Yun to bring her dressing table. Su Yun then produced her own makeup and cheerfully said, “Our Granny doesn’t have much in the way of these things. If you don’t mind a little ‘cure’ [a pun on preserving makeup], you might as well use mine.” Miss Li remarked, “Even if I have none, you should take it from the young ladies’ supply—how can you openly display yours? Fortunately it is yours; if it were someone else’s, they’d be angry, wouldn’t they?” Lady You laughed and said, “What’s the harm in it?” While speaking, she washed her face. A maid bent over to hold the basin. Miss Li chided, “Why is that so disorderly?” The maid hastily knelt down. Lady You laughed, “In our household, people from the highest to the lowest only talk about the appearances on the outside—putting on airs and formalities, yet when it comes to actual deeds, they are perfectly capable.” At these words, Miss Li, already aware of what had transpired the previous night, smiled and said, “There is some truth in what you say. But tell me, who exactly was responsible for those deeds?” Lady You replied, “You ask me? Could it be that you were so ill as to go through the阴 (yin) period?”  Before she could finish her sentence, a servant announced, “Miss Bao has arrived!” Both quickly exclaimed, “Please come in!” and Miss Bao Cai stepped in. Lady You hastily wiped her face and rose to invite her to sit, then asked, “Why did you come in alone? The other sisters are nowhere to be seen.” Miss Bao replied, “Indeed. I haven’t seen them either. It is just that today our Granny is feeling uneasy, and the two women in the house haven’t yet been taken ill by the seasonal symptoms; the others are not to be relied upon. I, for my part, intend to go out tonight to keep the elder company. I plan to visit both the old matriarch and Madame; I think it’s nothing serious and hardly worth mentioning – after all, sooner or later I will come in again. So I’ve come to give our eldest sister a word.” Miss Li, upon hearing this, only smiled at Lady You, and Lady You returned the smile. In a short time, after Lady You had finished washing up, everyone sat down to enjoy tea with some noodles. Miss Li, still smiling, said to Miss Bao, “Since that is so, send someone to inquire about Auntie’s health – ask what ailment she has. I too am unwell and cannot come to see her myself. Dear sister, you go without hesitation; I’ll send someone to check on your room. After all, you are staying here for at least a day or two, so do not let me be at fault.” Miss Bao laughed and said, “What fault? It is only natural. Besides, you never sold out a thief. In my opinion, there’s no need to add more people; why not simply invite Yunyatou to stay with you for a day or two? Wouldn’t that be more convenient?” Lady You replied, “But what of Sister Shi? Where did she go?” Miss Bao answered, “I just sent someone to fetch your little spy, asking her to come over here, and I will let her know clearly.”  Just then, someone reported, “Miss Yun and Miss San have arrived!” After everyone had been seated, Miss Bao announced her intention to go out. Miss Tan Chun remarked, “Excellent. Not only has Aunt recovered, but her arrival, even if delayed, is acceptable.” Lady You laughed, “That’s odd—how can you start expelling relatives?” Miss Tan Chun sneered, “Precisely. If others were expelling, I’d rather expel them first. Relatives are fine, but there’s no need for them to stick around forever. After all, we are all kin—each one is no more than a clucking black-eyed chicken!
Suddenly the clock on the shelf chimed; he looked at the clock—it was about two of the evening watches. A little maid then lit the lamp, and Xiren said, “Since you’re not eating, have half a bowl of hot porridge, so you don’t starve and weaken further.” Baoyu shook his head, “I’m not that hungry; forced eating wouldn’t do me any good.” Xiren said, “Then you’d better rest early.” Thus Xiren and Mèiyue arranged his bedding. Baoyu, however, tossed and turned and could not sleep. At dawn, after a short meal he slept again. At this time, both Xiren and Mèiyue had risen. Xiren said, “Last night I heard you tossing until the fifth watch—I didn’t dare ask. I eventually fell asleep; did you manage to sleep at all?” Baoyu replied, “I did sleep a bit, though I’m not sure how I awoke.” Xiren inquired, “Are you feeling unwell?” Baoyu answered, “No, just troubled in my heart.” Xiren then asked, “Are you going to the study today?” Baoyu replied, “I took a day off yesterday; today I’d like to stroll in the garden to clear my mind, though I’m afraid of the cold. Have the servants tidy a room, set up a furnace with incense, and lay out paper, ink, brushes, and an inkstone. You all may attend to your own matters—I intend to sit quietly for a while without disturbance.” Mèiyue added, “Second Master wishes to have undisturbed time; no one should come interrupt.” Xiren said, “That’s fine—it will keep you from catching a chill, and your mind can be at ease.” Then she asked, “Since you’re skipping a meal, what shall we tell the kitchen to prepare?” Baoyu replied, “Just something simple. Perhaps a few fruits placed in that room, to lend a pleasant fragrance.” Xiren said, “Which room? Most are not very clean; only the one originally occupied by Qingwen, since no one lives there, remains tidy, albeit a bit cold.” Baoyu said, “No matter—move the fire basin over there and it will do.” Xiren agreed. Just then a little maid appeared carrying a tea tray, a bowl, and a pair of chopsticks. She handed them to Mèiyue, saying, “This is what Hua Girl requested—sent by the old cook from the kitchen.” Mèiyue inspected the bowl; it turned out to be a bowl of bird’s-nest soup. He asked Xiren, “Is this for Sister?” Xiren laughed, “Last night, since Second Master didn’t eat and tossed all night, I suspected he’d wake up with an empty heart—so I had the kitchen prepare this.” Xiren then ordered the maid to set the table. Soon after, Qiu Wen came by saying, “That room has been tidied up; but wait until the coals are properly burning, then Second Master may enter.” Baoyu nodded, though his mind was elsewhere and his words slow. After a while, a little maid announced, “The brushes and ink have been set up.” Baoyu said, “Understood.” Another little maid returned, “Breakfast is ready—where shall Second Master eat?” Baoyu replied, “Just bring it here; no need for extra fuss.” The maid left, and soon a meal was served. Baoyu smiled faintly and said to Mèiyue and Xiren, “I’m so troubled inside that I fear I can’t eat; perhaps if you both join me, and the meal tastes sweet, I might eat a bit more.” Mèiyue laughed, “That is Second Master’s whim—you honor us, but we dare not.” Xiren added, “Indeed, sometimes sharing wine together is acceptable; but if we do it too earnestly, it would break decorum.” They sat down—Baoyu at the head, with Xiren and Mèiyue beside him. After the meal, a little maid brought mouth-rinse tea, and after a short while, the maid left.
Daiyu paused and strained her ears but could not make out whose cry it was or what sorrowful words were being uttered. Curious, she approached slowly. There, she saw a maid with thick brows and large eyes weeping. At first, Daiyu suspected that one of the senior maids in the household might be venting her woes; but on closer look, she could not recognize the girl. The maid, noticing Daiyu’s approach, ceased her crying and wiped away her tears. Daiyu asked, “Why are you so heartbroken?” The maid, still crying, said, “Miss Lin, please judge the matter. When they speak, I don’t know what to say—I just uttered one wrong word, and my elder sister beat me!” Daiyu, not quite understanding, asked, “Who is your elder sister?” The maid replied, “It’s Sister Zhenzhu.” Only then did Daiyu realize that the maid belonged to Jia Mu’s household. She inquired further, “And what is your name?” The maid answered, “I’m called ‘Silly Big Sister.’” Daiyu smiled gently and asked, “And why did your sister beat you? What did you say?” The maid replied, “It was about Second Master Baoyu marrying Miss Bao.” At the sound of this, Daiyu was struck like a bolt of lightning; her heart pounded wildly. Gathering herself, she beckoned, “Come with me.” The maid followed Daiyu to the secluded spot by the peach-blossom tomb. There, behind a quiet outcrop, Daiyu asked, “Why did they beat you over Baoyu marrying Miss Bao?” “Silly Big Sister” explained, “Our old lady, Madam Wang, and Second Mistress discussed it. Since our old master is to leave soon, they decided to hurry off to negotiate with the second mistress to bring Miss Bao into the family. First, they intended it as a ‘good luck’ match for Second Master; then… ” At this point she smiled at Daiyu before continuing, “They even mentioned to Miss Lin about the bride’s family.” Daiyu was left dumbfounded. The maid continued, “I don’t know exactly how they agreed—everyone was told not to speak out loud for fear that Miss Bao might overhear and get upset. I casually mentioned to Sister Xiren in Baoyu’s room, ‘Tomorrow will be even more lively—both Miss Bao and Second Mistress will be here! What shall we call it then?’ No sooner had I said that than my sister came over and struck me across the face, calling me a blabbermouth for not following orders, and threatened to drive me out. I understand why we are not allowed to speak freely—since you all did not tell me, she beat me.” Tears resumed as she sobbed. Daiyu’s heart was a tangle of sweetness and bitterness, as if sugar, salt, vinegar, and sourness were mixed together—she could not decide what flavor to name. After a while, her voice trembled as she said, “Stop prattling on. If you keep this up and someone hears you, you’ll be beaten again. Now go on your way.” Then, turning to leave, Daiyu found that her legs felt as though they bore a thousand pounds; though her feet seemed to tread on soft cotton, they had grown weak. Step by step, she trudged along slowly. After walking for a long while, she had not yet reached the banks of Qinfang Bridge. For her steps were feeble and her mind muddled, and she inadvertently wandered off the proper path, extending her journey by several more paces. At length, she arrived at the edge of Qinfang Bridge—but then, as if unconsciously drawn back along the embankment, she began to retrace her steps. Zizhuan, having fetched the handkerchief, looked about and did not see Daiyu. While searching, she spied a figure with a pallid, ashen face—Daiyu, staggering slightly, turning this way and that. Then, from a distance, another maid was seen moving ahead, though too far away to be clearly identified. Alarmed and uncertain, Zizhuan hurried over and softly asked, “Miss, where are you headed? Are you going somewhere?” In her confused state, Daiyu murmured, “I… I’m going to ask Baoyu.” Zizhuan, perplexed, helped steady her and led her back toward Jia Mu’s courtyard.
She longed for Zijuan’s return. Just then, the sound of footsteps outside made her tense up until she recognized Zijuan had returned. Hastily, Xueyan rose and lifted the inner curtain to peer out. Through the rustling fabric, she saw someone entering—none other than the clerk whom Tan-chun had sent earlier to check on Daiyu. Noticing Xueyan lifting the curtain, he asked, “How is the young mistress?”  Xueyan nodded and called him in. The clerk followed, and upon seeing that Zijuan was absent, he inspected Daiyu. All he found was a faint, feeble breath—her life hanging by a thread—which startled him deeply. “Where is Sister Zijuan?” he inquired. Xueyan replied, “I was told she went up to the next room.”  At that moment, overcome by concern, Xueyan quietly grasped the clerk’s hand and in a low voice asked, “Was it true what you mentioned the other day—that Wang (or ‘Big Wang’) had arranged a marriage proposal for our Second Master?” The clerk answered, “How could it not be true?” Xueyan pressed, “When was it fixed?” He replied, “It wasn’t arranged very long ago. The day I told you, I had heard it from Little Hong. Later, when I visited Second Aunt’s place, I overheard her discussing with Peaceful Sister: ‘Those are but the court officials’ schemes to curry favor with the Master. Even if the First Madam disapproves, if she is willing and deems the girl good, it will be apparent to her. Moreover, Grandmother’s heart has already chosen someone—someone living in our garden. Grandmother only inquired because of what the Master said.’ I also heard Second Aunt remark, ‘As for Baoyu, Grandmother insists on a personal match—no matter who is chosen, it won’t be effective.’”  Overhearing this, Xueyan nearly forgot her despair and said, “How can that be? It seems we’ve needlessly sacrificed our only hope.” The clerk asked, “From where did you hear all this?” Xueyan replied, “You still don’t know? Just the other day, when I was speaking with Sister Zijuan, this matter was mentioned—and once he heard it, things have come to this pass.” The clerk cautioned softly, “You must speak quietly so that he may not overhear.” Xueyan whispered, “Within just a day or two…” Before they could continue, Zijuan re-entered, lifting the curtain. “Enough!” she cried, “If you have any more to say, take it outside! Speak all you want—and then perhaps drive him to death if need be!” The clerk objected, “I cannot believe such a thing is possible.” Zijuan retorted, “Oh, dear sister, you’d be angry again! What do you know? Even if you do, it is not for you to share.”  The three of them were deep in discussion when suddenly Daiyu let out a cough. Zijuan immediately knelt by the kang, and both the clerk and Xueyan fell silent. Zijuan bent low behind Daiyu and gently inquired, “Miss, would you like some water?” Daiyu managed a faint assent. Xueyan quickly fetched half a jar of hot boiled water. Zijuan took it, and the clerk drew nearer. Both Zijuan and he shook their heads, urging her not to speak; the clerk swallowed his words. After a moment, Daiyu coughed again. Seizing the opportunity, Zijuan urged, “Miss, drink some water!” Daiyu again murmured a soft reply. Though she seemed about to lift her head, her strength failed her. Zijuan clambered onto the kang beside her, gently tested the water’s temperature, and brought the bowl to Daiyu’s lips. As she was about to take it, Daiyu indicated she wished to drink on her own; so Zijuan carefully held the bowl still. Daiyu took a small sip, then shook her head as if to refuse more, and after a brief pause, lay back down. After some time, with her eyes barely open, she murmured, “Was it not the clerk who spoke earlier?” Zijuan confirmed, “Yes, indeed.” Before the clerk could leave, he quickly came over to offer his greetings.
Moreover, to play the zither, one must commit its notes to heart—something not done idly. In my opinion, dear sister, with your delicate health, it’s better not to trouble yourself with it.” Daiyu smiled softly. Baoyu pointed to the qin hanging on the wall and said, “Is this qin so short?” Daiyu laughed, “It is not short; when I was a child learning to play, the other qins were too large to handle, so this one was specially made for me. Though it is not the withered phoenix-tail of a Fuyong qin, its matching of the crane’s and phoenix’s features is just right—the dragons in its inlays and the subtle patterns evoke a clear, transcendent tone.” Baoyu then asked, “Sister, have you written any poetry these past few days?” Daiyu replied, “Since our society was formed, I have not composed much.” Baoyu laughed, “Don’t hide it from me. I recall hearing you recite a line like ‘How can pure heart compare to the moon in heaven?’—you set it into the qin’s melody, and it rang so clearly. What other verses have you composed?” Daiyu asked, “How did you hear that?” Baoyu said, “I heard it the other day coming from Liao Feng Pavilion, but I was afraid to disturb your pure melody, so I listened quietly for a while and then left. I was about to ask: at first the verse is in a level tone, but toward the end it shifts to a slanted tone—what does that mean?” Daiyu replied, “It is simply the natural expression of the human heart—the music flows as it must, with no fixed form.” Baoyu said, “I see. Alas, I do not have the refined taste to appreciate it; I only listened for a while in vain.” Daiyu sighed, “How few kindred spirits there have ever been in all ages!” Baoyu, realizing he had spoken too boldly and fearing he might chill Daiyu’s delicate heart further, fell silent. They sat together in quiet contemplation. Though Baoyu felt many things within, he found nothing more to say. Recalling his earlier words, which had spilled out impulsively, Daiyu felt they were too blunt. “If you meet Third Sister, please send her my regards,” she said. Baoyu agreed and departed. After escorting Daiyu to the door, he returned alone, sitting gloomily and thinking, “Lately, Baoyu’s words are so ambiguous—half-hearted, at times cold, at times warm—I do not know what he means.” Lost in thought, he barely noticed when Zijuan approached and asked, “Miss, have you finished writing? Shall I put away your brush and ink?” Daiyu replied, “I have finished; just pack them up.” Then, she went into her inner room and sat on her bed, leaning slightly as she pondered deeply. Zijuan returned and gently asked, “Miss, would you like a cup of tea?” Daiyu answered, “No, I’m not hungry—I’m just feeling a bit off. You all go on.” Zijuan left, and soon Snow Goose was found sitting quietly, lost in thought. Zijuan approached and asked, “Are you troubled too?” Snow Goose, startled out of his reverie, said, “Don’t shout—listen, today I heard something remarkable. Let me tell you, but don’t speak of it aloud.” He then cupped his hand around his mouth as if to keep a secret. Gathering courage, he beckoned Zijuan outside to the doorway, and in a hushed tone he said, “Sister, did you hear? They say that Baoyu has now been betrothed.” Zijuan gasped, “Where did you hear such a thing? It must not be true, must it?” Snow Goose insisted, “It’s as true as can be! Everyone else seems to know, only we hadn’t heard it.” Zijuan asked, “Where did you hear it?” Snow Goose replied, “I overheard the clerk talking—it was said that a certain governor’s family, with ample wealth and renowned talents, is involved.” Just then, they heard a cough from within; it seemed Daiyu was stirring.
And now, we’re out here publicly hunting for jade—what is the meaning of this!” He then briskly went inside to question Madam Wang. Madam Wang recounted every detail. Knowing it was the old lady’s idea, Jia Zheng dared not oppose it—though he grumbled a few words to Madam Wang. Later, he went out again and secretly had the posted notice taken down, hiding it from the old lady. But it turned out that idle gossipers had already removed it. After a while, someone came to the Rong Mansion gate claiming to have delivered the jade. The family, upon hearing this, were delighted and said, “Bring it in, so we can return it to you.” The man then produced the reward notice from inside his pocket and showed it to the gatekeepers, saying, “Isn’t this your family’s notice? It states that whoever delivers the jade will receive 10,000 taels of silver. Second Master, do you think I’m poor? Once I have the silver, I’ll be rich—don’t treat me with such disregard.” The gatekeeper, taking him at his word, said, “Show me the jade so I can return it to our master.” At first the man hesitated, but later, hearing that it was proper, he took out the jade and held it aloft in his palm, asking, “Isn’t this it?” The family, mostly serving outside and rarely in possession of such a jade, were awestruck as they examined its appearance. They rushed inside to report it. That day, when Jia Zheng and Jia She had been out, only Jia Lian was at home. When they returned, Jia Lian asked, “Is it genuine?” A gatekeeper replied, “I saw it with my own eyes. But I cannot hand it over without first showing it to our master—one hand for the silver, the other for the jade.” Jia Lian was delighted. He quickly reported to Madam Wang, and later to Jia Mu, while Xiren clapped her hands in joyful prayer. Jia Mu, however, was unyielding. He ordered, “Hurry, have Lian’er invite that man into the study so we may examine the jade. If it is as stated, we will pay him the silver immediately.” Following orders, Jia Lian invited the man in and treated him as a guest, thanking him profusely: “If I may borrow this jade until I present it to our master—and I promise not to shortchange you in silver—please.” The man had no choice but to send over a package wrapped in red silk. When Jia Lian unwrapped it, was it not the same translucent, beautiful jade? Jia Lian, who had never been one to question such things, now took a keen look. After a long while, he could almost make out the inscriptions—words like “ward off evil” and so on. Delighted, Jia Lian called for the servants and hurried to present it to Jia Mu and Madam Wang. The whole family was stirred; everyone eagerly gathered to examine it. Fengjie, upon seeing Jia Lian come in, snatched it immediately, unwilling to let anyone else see it first, and delivered it to Jia Mu. Jia Lian laughed and said, “To think such a trivial matter would allow me to score a merit!” When Jia Mu unwrapped the jade, he noticed that it seemed considerably duller than before. He rubbed it with his hand, and Yuanyang put on her spectacles to inspect it. “Strange,” she said, “this jade indeed is something—but where has the brilliant luster vanished?” Madam Wang, after examining it for a while, could not recognize it either and called Fengjie over. Fengjie observed, “It does look familiar, though the color is somewhat off. Perhaps we should have Baoyu examine it himself—then all will be clear.” Xiren, who was watching from the side, also looked on, silently praying that it truly was the one, though she dared not voice any doubts. Thus, Fengjie took the jade from Jia Mu’s hands and, together with Xiren, brought it to Baoyu for his inspection. At that moment, Baoyu, who had just awakened from sleep, lazily accepted it without closely inspecting, and tossed it to the ground, saying, “Here you go—yet again, you are trying to fool me.” He merely gave a cold laugh.
Xueyan had already come in carrying a small tea tray with a cup of medicine and a cup of water, while a little maid came in behind with a basin for rinsing. Originally, when Xiren arrived, she intended to gauge the atmosphere and sat for a while without broaching any topic. She reasoned that since Daiyu was so sensitive, any probing might upset her further. After sitting for a while, she exchanged a few words and took her leave. As she reached the gate of the Hongyuan Courtyard, she saw two people standing there, and she hesitated to go forward. One of them, having seen her, hurried over. When Xiren looked, it turned out to be Chuo Yao. She asked, “What are you doing?” Chuo Yao replied, “Just now, Second Young Master Yun came with a note, saying it was for our Second Master to see, and I’m here waiting for the message.” Xiren said, “Baoyu is at school every day—don’t you know? What message could there be?” Chuo Yao laughed and said, “I told him, and he said to tell you, so you should be expecting his letter.” Just then, another person slowly shuffled over. Upon closer inspection, it was none other than Jia Yun, who sidled over. Recognizing him, Xiren quickly said to Chuo Yao, “Just tell him that I got it, and to have it delivered to Second Master when he returns.” Jia Yun had intended to speak with Xiren—merely to ingratiate himself—but not daring to be presumptuous, he ambled slowly. Standing not far apart, Xiren, upon saying those words, felt awkward to continue forward and thus turned away. Jia Yun, dejected, had no choice but to leave with Chuo Yao. That evening, when Baoyu returned to his room, Xiren said, “Today, little Yun came by the corridor.” Baoyu asked, “About what?” Xiren replied, “He also brought a note.” Baoyu said, “Where is it? Hand it over so I can see.” Mèiyuè went off to fetch it from some documents in the inner room. Baoyu took it and saw that on the cover it read, “Greetings from Uncle.” Baoyu said, “Why does this child no longer acknowledge me as his father?” Xiren asked, “What do you mean?” Baoyu replied, “The year before last when he sent me a white begonia, he addressed me as ‘Father’; but today the envelope cover says ‘Uncle’—has he now disowned me?” Xiren said, “He’s shameless, and so are you—though he’s grown up, to call you such a term shows his impudence. You’re supposed to be a proper…” Just then, as she spoke, her face reddened and she gave a slight smile. Baoyu, realizing the implication, said, “It’s hard to say—the common saying goes: ‘Among monks, many are filial sons.’ I suppose he’s simply clever and knows how to win hearts. If he doesn’t want to acknowledge me, I wouldn’t mind.” As he spoke, he began to tear open the note. Xiren laughed and said, “That little Yun is always so mischievous—always wanting to be noticed one moment and then hiding the next; it’s clear he has dubious intentions.” Baoyu was absorbed in reading the characters on the note and paid no heed to Xiren’s remarks. When Xiren saw him frowning, she smiled gently and shook her head. Eventually, growing rather impatient, she asked, “What does it say?” But Baoyu did not answer; he had already torn the note into several pieces. Seeing this, Xiren thought it best not to press further and asked, “After eating, why don’t you read a bit?” Baoyu said, “That silly Yun! What a scoundrel—messing about like this!” Noticing that his answer was off-topic, Xiren smiled mildly and inquired, “What exactly is going on?” Baoyu replied, “I asked him, ‘What are you doing?’ Let’s eat and then rest. My mind is in such a tizzy.” With that, he called for a little maid to light a fire and burned the torn pieces of the note.
The pain and the strange mixture of fever and sorrow left her weak. Ziyuan and Xiren tried to comfort her, urging her to rest and recover. Later that day, as Bao Yu resumed his studies at the family school under the supervision of Dai-ru, he was forced to recite his compositions to Jia Zheng. Though his teacher critiqued his work harshly for its immaturity, Bao Yu resolved to improve his studies—knowing that his future depended on it. His classmates and even some of the household officials gathered to listen, and amidst the scholarly discussion, Bao Yu’s heart remained conflicted. Chapter 85  Jia Cun’s Weekly Report of Promotion to Langzhong, and Xue Wenqi Again Incites the Punishment of Exile  It is said that Lady Zhao was in the room complaining about Jia Huan when she heard Jia Huan from an adjacent room exclaim, “I merely knocked over the medicine bottle and spilled a little, and that maid still didn’t die! Now they’re all cursing me, saying I’m heartless and trying to see me suffer to death? Just wait till tomorrow—I’ll have that little maid’s life taken away too! Let’s see how you all handle that; you just tell them to be on guard!” Lady Zhao hurried out from the inner room and clamped his mouth shut, saying, “You can’t just spout nonsense like that—and now you’re inciting people to take your life first!” The two quarreled for a while. Lady Zhao, hearing what Sister Feng had said, became even more angry, and did not even send someone to comfort Sister Feng. A few days later, Qiao Jie’er recovered, and thus the enmity between the two sides deepened further. One day, Lin Zhixiao came in and announced, “Today is the birthday of the Prince of Beijing, please convey His Lordship’s instructions.” Jia Zheng ordered, “Just follow the old annual custom; report back to the great master and send the gift accordingly.” Lin Zhixiao agreed and went off to make the arrangements. Before long, Jia She arrived and, after consulting with Jia Zheng, took Jia Zhen, Jia Lian, and Baoyu to pay respects to the Prince of Bejing on his birthday. While others had little to say, Baoyu, who had long admired the prince’s looks and dignity, was eager to see him as often as possible; he quickly changed his clothes and followed along to the Northern Mansion. Jia She and Jia Zheng handed over the official appointment documents. Not long after, a eunuch appeared, holding a string of prayer beads. Seeing Jia She and Jia Zheng, he greeted them with a cheerful “Good day, my lords!” Jia She and Jia Zheng quickly returned the greetings, and soon the three brothers also came forward to exchange pleasantries. The eunuch then announced, “The prince has summoned you inside.” So the five of them followed the eunuch into the mansion. Passing two sets of doors and turning into a hall, they reached the inner palace gate. When they arrived at the gate, everyone halted, and the eunuch went ahead to inform the prince. At the door, several junior eunuchs greeted them in turn. Soon the same eunuch reappeared and said a single word, “Please,” and the five, in respectful unison, entered. There they saw the Prince of Bejing, dressed in ceremonial attire, already waiting under the eaves of the hall. Jia She and Jia Zheng approached first to offer their respects, followed in turn by Zhen, Lian, and Baoyu. The prince then pulled Baoyu aside and said, “I haven’t seen you for a long time; you have been on my mind.” Then he smiled and asked, “And how is your piece of jade?” Baoyu, bowing deeply and replying in measured tones, said, “Under the protection of your lordship, it is well.” The prince said, “Today when you come, there isn’t any delicacy for you to eat—let’s just have a conversation instead.” A few servants drew the curtain aside. The prince said, “Please,” and went in first, followed by Jia She and the others, all bowing as they entered. First, Jia She offered the formal salute to the prince, who in turn expressed a few humble words.
When Baoyu reached the study, he began his lessons. Suddenly, a harsh wind rattled against the paper window. The substitute teacher remarked, “The weather has shifted again.” He pushed open the wind-shutter, and they saw on the northwest a mass of dark clouds steadily rolling toward the southeast. Soon, Bei Ming returned to Baoyu, saying, “Second Master, it’s cold—fetch more clothes.” Baoyu nodded. Bei Ming then brought in a garment. Baoyu, at first not looking at it, soon examined it with rapt attention; all the small students crowded to gawk. It turned out to be that “sparrow-gold” jacket that Qingwen had mended. Baoyu asked, “Who gave you this?” Bei Ming replied, “It was prepared by the maidservants inside.” Baoyu said, “I’m not very cold; I’d rather keep it wrapped up.” The substitute teacher assumed that Baoyu cherished frugality, and though Bei Ming urged, “Second Master, wear it. If you catch a cold, it will be my fault; please consider my care,” Baoyu, with little alternative, donned it and sat staring at his books. The teacher took it for granted that Baoyu was absorbed in his studies, and said little more. That evening, when lessons ended, Baoyu went to ask the teacher for a day’s leave on account of illness. The elderly substitute, who was himself prone to various aches and pains and often enjoyed the company of the children, happily granted his request—knowing full well that Jia Zheng was busy and that Grandmother’s indulgence prevailed. Baoyu returned home, paid his respects to Grandmother and Madam Wang, and after a brief conversation, went back to the garden. There, he met Xiren and others, but unlike his usual cheerful self, he seemed sullen; he lay on the kang (heated platform) in his clothes. Xiren said, “Dinner is ready. Would you like to eat now or wait a bit?” Baoyu replied, “I’m not hungry—I feel unwell. You all eat without me.” Xiren then added, “In that case, you should change out of that garment. How can that thing stand all this wear and tear?” Baoyu answered, “No need to change it.” Xiren pressed, “Not only is it a delicate thing, but look at the stitches on it—they shouldn’t be subjected to such abuse.” Baoyu sighed deeply, as those words struck his heart. “Then pack it away and keep it for me—I won’t wear it any longer!” He got up and undressed. By the time Xiren went to help, Baoyu had already neatly folded the garment. Xiren asked, “Why are you being so particular today?” Baoyu said nothing further. Once his folding was complete, he asked, “Where is the packing bundle?” Mèiyue quickly handed it over. With a conspiratorial glance at Xiren, he smiled. Yet Baoyu remained morose, sitting silently. Suddenly the clock on the shelf chimed; he looked at the clock—it was about two of the evening watches. A little maid then lit the lamp, and Xiren said, “Since you’re not eating, have half a bowl of hot porridge, so you don’t starve and weaken further.” Baoyu shook his head, “I’m not that hungry; forced eating wouldn’t do me any good.” Xiren said, “Then you’d better rest early.” Thus Xiren and Mèiyue arranged his bedding. Baoyu, however, tossed and turned and could not sleep. At dawn, after a short meal he slept again. At this time, both Xiren and Mèiyue had risen. Xiren said, “Last night I heard you tossing until the fifth watch—I didn’t dare ask. I eventually fell asleep; did you manage to sleep at all?” Baoyu replied, “I did sleep a bit, though I’m not sure how I awoke.” Xiren inquired, “Are you feeling unwell?” Baoyu answered, “No, just troubled in my heart.” Xiren then asked, “Are you going to the study today?” Baoyu replied, “I took a day off yesterday; today I’d like to stroll in the garden to clear my mind, though I’m afraid of the cold.
Startled, he thought, “It can’t be Baocan—it must be Jin Gui.” Yet, he resolved not to pay them any further heed, waiting to see what trick they might play. For a long while he strained his ears, but there was only silence. Unwilling to even partake of the wine and fruit, he shut his door. Just as he was about to undress, he heard a slight rustle on the window paper. Already having been toyed with by Baocan the previous night, Xue Ke’s heart pounded with confusion and uncertainty. Listening intently to the faint sound, he looked closely, but found no movement—only then did suspicion seize him. He sank onto a chair by the lamp, turning over a piece of fruit in his hand as he pondered. Suddenly, he glanced back and discovered that a portion of the paper on the window was damp. Approaching it to inspect, a cold gust blew from outside accompanied by a series of creaking, laughing sounds that startled him greatly. In his fright, Xue Ke quickly blew out the lamp and lay perfectly still, holding his breath. From outside, a voice cried, “Second Master, why do you not drink your wine and eat your fruit before going to sleep?” The tone unmistakably echoed Baocan’s. Xue Ke, feigning sleep, remained silent. A couple more remarks followed—one, in a tone of bitter reproach, exclaimed, “What man in all the world is so hapless?” The words seemed to be uttered partly by Baocan and partly by Jin Gui, and Xue Ke understood their meaning at last. He tossed and turned in his thoughts until he finally managed to sleep after the fifth watch. At dawn, someone knocked at his door. Xue Ke called out, “Who is it?” but received no answer. Reluctantly, he rose and opened the door to find Baocan standing there, his hair disheveled and his arms wrapped around himself. He was dressed in a tight-fitting jacket with gold-trimmed pipa-style collar, secured by a half-new, pine-green sweatband; below, he wore no skirt at all, revealing stone-pomegranate–red embroidered breeches and a pair of newly embroidered red shoes. It turned out Baocan had not yet washed up and had come early to collect his things. Seeing him thus attired, Xue Ke invited him in with a polite smile and asked, “What brings you up so early?”  Baocan blushed and said nothing, but simply folded the fruit into a small dish and departed. Observing his departure, Xue Ke surmised that whatever had transpired the previous night had been set in motion. He thought, “So be it; if they are angry enough, they may have completely made up their minds—and that spares me the trouble of further entanglement.” With his heart at last easing, he ordered someone to fetch water to wash his face and resolved to remain at home for a few days to recuperate, fearing that if he ventured out, someone might come looking for him. Meanwhile, those who had long been on friendly terms with Xue Pan—seeing that the Xue household was empty except for the young, inexperienced Xue Ke—began to covet his position. Some schemed to insert themselves as errand runners; others, capable of serving as assistants or scribes, hoped to manage his affairs; still others planned to extort money from him; and there were even those who spread menacing rumors. Xue Ke, noticing these intruders from afar, did his best to avoid them, though he dared not confront them directly for fear of provoking an unforeseen calamity. Instead, he hid within his home, awaiting further developments—a matter he did not elaborate on. That very night, Jin Gui had sent Baocan some wine and fruit to “probe” Xue Ke’s condition, and Baocan returned and recounted every detail of Xue Ke’s plight. When Jin Gui found that events were not proceeding entirely to his liking, he feared that the whole affair might backfire and that Baocan would look down on him; he tried to cover his tracks with a few evasive remarks but found himself at a loss. Distraught and seated in silent contemplation, Jin Gui had no clear plan until he resolved, at last, that perhaps the next morning he should go retrieve his belongings and, without even washing, change into one or two sets of delicately colored garments—thereby displaying a languid, unkempt charm that might provoke a reaction in Xue Ke. His thought was that if Xue Ke showed any sign of remorse, he would naturally withdraw, leaving Jin Gui’s scheme intact.
After a short walk of no more than a hundred steps, they reached the ridge of the main peak, where stood an open hall. Since it was high on the ridge, it was named “Tubi Mountain Villa.” Before the hall, on a terrace, tables and chairs were arranged in a circle; a large screen partition was used to divide the space into two sections. All the tables and chairs were round, symbolizing unity. In the center sat Grandmother Jia; to her left were Jia She, Jia Zhen, Jia Lian, and Jia Rong; to her right were Jia Zheng, Bao Yu, Jia Huan, and Jia Lan. They sat in a circle with only half the table occupied – the other half left empty. Grandmother Jia laughed and said, “In the past we did not feel there were few people, but tonight it seems that our family is indeed rather small – not very impressive. I recall that in earlier days there would be three or four dozen men and women, how lively it used to be! But today, let the girls sit over there instead.” Then she ordered that the three young ladies, Ying Chun, Tan Chun, and Xi Chun, be called over to join the seating behind Mrs. Xing’s table. Jia Lian and Bao Yu came out together to seat them first, and then everyone sat down in order. Grandmother Jia then commanded that a branch of osmanthus be broken off, and a wife be sent behind the screen with a drum to pass the flower: “Whoever has the flower in hand must drink a cup of wine and then tell a joke as a penalty.”  Thus, starting with Grandmother Jia, then Jia She, and so on, they each took turns. After a couple of drum beats, the passing stopped when it reached Jia Zheng, who had to drink his wine. All the sisters and brothers would secretly pull each other and gently squeeze one another, smiling as they anticipated hearing a joke. Seeing Grandmother Jia so pleased, Jia Zheng had to oblige. Just as he was about to speak, Grandmother Jia laughed and said, “If what you say is not funny, you must be punished.” Jia Zheng laughed and said, “There is only one option; if it’s not funny, then I shall gladly accept punishment.” Grandmother Jia said, “Then say that one thing.” Jia Zheng then said, “In our family, the one most afraid of his wife is the man who only speaks that one sentence, and everyone laughed because we had never heard you say anything else.” Grandmother Jia laughed, “That must be good.” Jia Zheng laughed, “If that is so, then let the old lady have an extra cup.” Grandmother Jia laughed, “So be it.” Jia She quickly handed a cup to Jia Zheng while attendants stood by. Jia Zheng took the cup, placed it before Grandmother Jia, and she drank a sip. Jia She and Jia Zheng then returned to their places. Then Jia Zheng said, “This man who is afraid of his wife never dares to take another step. Yet on that day – the fifteenth of August – when he went out to buy things, he encountered a few friends who insisted on dragging him home for a drink. After getting drunk, he slept at a friend’s house. The next day, upon waking and regretting it, he had no choice but to come home and make amends. His wife was washing her feet and said, ‘Since it is so, you must lick them for me, and then I’ll let you off.’ The man had no choice but to lick them, and couldn’t help but feel disgusted and nearly vomit. His wife then became angry and threatened to beat him, saying, ‘How dare you be so frivolous!’ The poor fellow immediately knelt and begged, ‘It wasn’t my dear mother’s foot that was pickled, it’s only that I drank too much huangjiu yesterday and ate mooncake filling, so I feel sour today.’” This account had Grandmother Jia and everyone laughing. Jia Zheng quickly poured another cup for Grandmother Jia. Grandmother Jia said, “Since that is so, quickly send someone to fetch some strong wine, so that those married men among you won’t be troubled.” Everyone laughed again. Only Jia Lian and Bao Yu dared not laugh heartily. Then the drum was struck again, starting with Jia Zheng, and by chance it stopped at Bao Yu.
Various humorous incidents ensued: Jia Zheng recounted a tale about a husband too timid to defy his wife’s commands, and even Bao Yu was coaxed into composing a poem on the spot when instructed by Jia Zheng, who set a challenge to use an “autumn” character to capture the scene. Grandmother Jia and the others laughed and rejoiced in the familial banter and the lighthearted games. There were further humorous anecdotes involving other family members—Jia She, Jia Huan, even an account of an acupuncture joke by a servant—and playful teasing that filled the evening with mirth and the gentle sound of laughter. At one point, as the night deepened, Grandmother Jia had wine poured for the flute player, and the distant, plaintive sound of the flute mingled with the clear moonlight. The music, though simple, evoked a profound, chilling beauty that moved everyone into a reflective silence, where each person, sitting under the gentle glow of the moon, felt their worries and cares lifted, even if only for a while. Then the flute was played again, its tone now more plaintive and sorrowful, and the assembled family sat in a pensive quietude. Gradually, as the night waned, various family members began to disperse, and a long conversation broke out among the maidservants about missing tea cups and other small items, which led to more laughter and playful banter. Meanwhile, Miss Daiyu and Xiangyun, who had not yet gone to sleep, found themselves inspired by the moon and the subtle music. They began to compose verses together—challenging each other in a friendly poetic contest that ranged from humorous and light to poignant and melancholy. Their playful exchange, filled with ingenious couplets and allusions to classical texts, evoked both admiration and gentle teasing from one another, until at length the conversation wound down, and the two eventually retired to their rooms, though not before a final round of witty poetic exchanges. As the night’s festivities continued, the chapter concludes with the promise that the story will be continued in the next installment. Chapter 77: The Beautiful Maid’s Complaint Reveals Unmatched Grace; The Delicate Beauty’s Pity Leads to a Tragic Fate at Shuiyue  It is said that after the Mid‐Autumn Festival had passed, Madame Wang observed that while Miss Feng’s illness had lessened somewhat, though not fully cured, she was now well enough to go about freely. Accordingly, Madame Wang ordered that the physician attend her daily to take her pulse and administer medicine. A new prescription for “Regulating and Nourishing the Menstrual and Vitality Pills” was drawn up. For this formula, two taels of the finest ginseng were required. However, when Madame Wang searched for it, she spent half a day only to find, in a small box, a few strands of ginseng no thicker than hairpins. Displeased, she ordered that they search further; soon they retrieved a large bundle of what appeared to be coarse “musty” bits. Frustrated, Madame Wang exclaimed, “It isn’t necessary to have it in such abundance—but if you use it, you must be able to find more! I keep asking you all to gather it in one place, but you never listen and just casually toss it aside.” Cai Yun replied, “I’m afraid that’s all there is. Last time the other madame came and took what was available.” Madame Wang said, “If that is so, then look carefully once again.” Cai Yun went off searching again and returned with several more bundles of medicinal material. “We do not recognize this variety,” she said, “so please, madame, inspect it for yourself. Apart from this, there is nothing else.” Opening the packages, Madame Wang found that she could not identify them at all – not a single strand of genuine ginseng was found. At once, she sent someone to ask Miss Feng if she had any. Miss Feng replied, “There are only a few ginseng extracts. Although there are a few strands of reed-root mustache, they are not of the finest quality and are needed daily for the decoction.” Hearing this, Madame Wang then inquired with Mrs. Xing, saying, “Because we ran out last time, I came here to look; it appears they have all been used up.” Having no alternative, Madame Wang resolved to personally ask Grandmother Jia. Grandmother Jia immediately ordered Yuan Yang to bring out the remaining supplies from that very day – and lo, there was a large bundle still kept, with pieces of varying thickness; she weighed out two taels and handed them over to Madame Wang.
If any maid were to find it and spread the word, our reputation would be ruined!”  Deeply embarrassed, Feng Xifeng knelt at the steps and, through tears, confessed, “Madam, I never meant for this to happen. That very sachet was a replica made outside—the tassels and all were bought from the market. Though I am young and do not consider myself haughty, I would never display such an item openly. Even if I did possess one, I would keep it hidden away in private; I could never possibly wear it in public. Besides, if it were to appear in our garden where all our sisters mingle, not only would they see it, but so would the servants—and our reputation would be at risk.”  Hearing this, Wang Furen’s eyes filled with tears. She called for Feng Xifeng to rise, and shortly afterward Jia Lian entered. After a few exchanges, Feng Xifeng confided that she needed to borrow silver for a matter concerning “Liu Jin Feng.” Jia Lian grinned and said, “Pray tell, what is the matter?”  Feng Xifeng explained that earlier someone had accused Liu Er Xifu and her sister of colluding during their gambling sessions—claiming that whatever the younger sister did was directed by her partner. “I thought you, who always advise me, would counsel that one matter is better than two so I might preserve my strength. But I did not heed, and now I have offended the Mistress—and, on top of that, contracted an illness. I see no recourse except to let them continue their mischief; after all, there are plenty of others. I have wasted my heart in vain, only to incur the curse of thousands; better that I focus on nursing myself back to health. When I recover, I shall conduct myself with propriety and joy, leaving all disputes for others to settle.”  Ping’er laughed and said, “Madam, you truly are one of a kind—such is our destiny indeed.”  Before long, Jia Lian entered again, clapping his hands and sighing, “Trouble has arisen again! The other day, while I was with Yuanyang, how did the Mistress learn of it? Earlier, she ordered me not to lend two hundred taels for the Mid‑Autumn Festival; I couldn’t borrow them anywhere. Then she said, ‘If you have no money, you must have a way to transfer funds—I’ve wasted my breath on you, and you have nowhere to turn! The thousand‐tael loan from that side—how is it arranged? Even the items Grandmother produced by magic, yet for two hundred taels you are at a loss! How regretful that I did not mention it sooner!’ I believe the Mistress clearly has plenty—why must we stir up more trouble?”  Feng Xifeng replied, “But there was no outsider that day—who let that news slip?”  Ping’er pondered for a long time and then laughed, “That’s right. It wasn’t during conversation when no one was around—it was later, when someone came to deliver goods at night. Grandmother’s ‘Silly Big Sister’s’ mother happened to be delivering freshly pressed garments, and while she was sitting in the lower room she saw a large chest of items and naturally inquired about them. The maids must have let it slip, and then the rumor spread.”  Accordingly, Ping’er summoned several little maids and asked, “Who told Silly Big Sister’s mother that day?”  The little maids, alarmed, knelt and swore solemnly, “None of us dared say more than a word! Whenever anyone asks, we all reply we know nothing—how could we dare speak?”  Feng Xifeng then explained in detail, “They wouldn’t dare say another word and risk blame. Let’s set this matter aside for now and focus on sending the Mistress away—it is most urgent. Better that we have fewer matters to worry about than cause further embarrassment.” Then she ordered, “Ping’er, take my gold ornaments and pledge them for two hundred taels of silver to settle this matter.”  Jia Lian remarked, “Might as well pledge an extra two hundred—we must show our resolve.”  Feng Xifeng replied, “There’s no need—I have no use for it. I’m not even sure which item is to be redeemed.”  Ping’er took the order and instructed Wang’er’s wife to handle it.
He took down the zither, only to say that he couldn’t manage it—and added, ‘If the old master is pleased, perhaps another day I might bring my zither and ask for guidance.’ I suppose our master did not understand, so he never returned. How is it that you have acquired such skill in keeping a score hidden?” Daiyu replied, “I’ve never truly mastered it. The other day, feeling a bit better, I was browsing the large bookcase and chanced upon a set of zither scores with great refinement. They explained the principles of the instrument so clearly—the techniques were laid out in detail. It is truly the work of the ancients in cultivating the mind and spirit. When I was in Yangzhou, I heard people speak of such refined matters and even studied a little, but I gave it up and that was that. Truly, ‘if one does not play for three days, one’s fingers become calloused with thorns.’ The scores I saw the other day had only the titles of pieces without the musical notation. I went elsewhere to find a version that included the actual musical passages, which made it all the more interesting. But exactly how to play it well remains an enigma. The texts say that when Shi Kuang played the zither, he could summon wind, thunder, dragons, and phoenixes; even Confucius himself learned the art from Shi Xiang, and a single piece would reveal the essence of King Wen. ‘High Mountains and Flowing Waters’—only by encountering a kindred spirit can one truly appreciate it.” At this, her eyes drooped slightly and she lowered her head. Baoyu, delighted by her explanation, said, “Sister, what you’ve just said is truly fascinating. But I have to confess: I cannot recognize a single character on the score. Will you teach me a few?” Daiyu replied, “There is no need—once explained, it is self-evident.” Baoyu persisted, “I’m a muddle-headed fellow. Please teach me that character which looks like a ‘big’ with a hook and a ‘wu’ in the middle.” Daiyu laughed and said, “That ‘big’ character with the ‘nine’ is actually produced by pressing your left thumb on the ‘nine-mark’ on the zither; the hook with the ‘wu’ is produced by your right hand plucking the ‘five-string’—they are not one character at all but represent a single note, and the method is very simple. In addition, there are techniques of ‘singing,’ ‘massaging,’ ‘tracing,’ ‘annotating,’ ‘bumping,’ ‘sliding,’ ‘flying,’ and ‘pushing’—all of which require careful hand technique.” Overjoyed, Baoyu clapped his hands and said, “Sister, since you understand zither theory so well, why don’t we learn to play it together?” Daiyu replied, “The art of the zither is not to be taken lightly. The ancients prescribed it as a means of self-cultivation—to restrain indulgence and curb extravagance. To play the zither properly, one must choose a quiet room or a high study, perhaps atop a multi-storied building, or nestled among trees and rocks, or even on a mountaintop or beside a river. Only when the heavens and earth are clear and harmonious, when the breeze is gentle and the moon bright, and with incense burning as one sits in silent meditation, free of worldly concerns and in a state of balanced energy, can the spirit and the Dao truly merge in harmony. Hence the ancients said, ‘A kindred spirit is hard to find.’ If there is no such soul to share with, it is better to play alone for the delight of the clear wind, bright moon, ancient pines, odd rocks, wild monkeys, or aged cranes—such is the only way not to waste one’s musical talent. Furthermore, one must have proper fingering and tone. If one is to play the zither, one must first dress appropriately—wearing formal attire or deep robes that reflect the style of the ancients, so as to be worthy of a sage’s instrument. Then, after washing one’s hands and burning incense, one may sit by one’s sideboard with the zither laid out, seated at the position marked by the fifth mark, facing one’s heart, and only then may one leisurely raise both hands in proper form.
After the meal, Jia Zheng returned with thanks. He later kowtowed at the ancestral hall and then went to pay his respects to Grandmother Jia. After exchanging a few words, he went out to attend to the guests. Meanwhile, a succession of relatives arrived and departed, bustling about with carriages and horses filling the courtyard, and the whole place was thronged with well-dressed company. Truly, it was as if:  When the flowers are in full bloom, bees and butterflies dance about; When the moon is full, the horizon is vast as the sea and sky. Thus, for two days, the celebration was in full swing. Early one morning, Wang Zisheng and other relatives had already delivered a troupe performing a play, setting up a stage in front of Grandmother Jia’s main hall. Outside, the gentlemen all wore official attire as they attended. Among the relatives congratulating, there were about a dozen tables of wine. Inside, because a new play was being performed—and with Grandmother Jia in high spirits—the colored-glass play screens were set up in the rear hall, and a banquet was arranged inside. At the head table, there was a table for Madam Xue accompanied by Madame Wang and Baoqin; opposite, at the elder lady’s table, were Second Madame Xing and Xiu Yan. Two tables below were still empty, and Grandmother Jia called out for them to come quickly. Soon, Sister Feng led a group of maidservants in a lively cluster bringing in Daiyu. Daiyu, having changed into a fresh new outfit, looked as if the goddess Chang’e had descended to the mortal world—modest and smiling as she greeted everyone. Xiangyun, Li Wen, and Li Qi all urged her to sit at the head table, but Daiyu refused. Grandmother Jia laughed, “Today, you must sit.” Madam Xue then stood up and asked, “Is there also a happy occasion for Miss Lin today?” Grandmother Jia laughed, “It is her birthday.” Madam Xue said, “Ah! I had forgotten,” and then added, “Pardon my forgetfulness—when you return, please have Baoqin come over to pay respects to sister.” Daiyu, laughing, said, “I dare not.” Everyone sat down. Noticing that Baochai was missing, Daiyu asked, “How is Sister Bao? Why hasn’t she come?” Madam Xue explained, “She was supposed to come, but there was no one to look after the house, so she did not come.” Daiyu blushed and smiled, “Aunt, now you have added another elder sister-in-law—why would Sister Bao be the one to look after the house? Perhaps she fears that too many people and too much bustle might make her lax. I do miss her.” Madam Xue laughed, “It is rare that you keep her in mind. She often misses you sisters as well. In a day or two, I’ll ask her to come so that we can all catch up.”  Just then, the maidservants descended to pour wine and serve dishes, and outside the play had already begun. The performance naturally opened with one or two auspicious acts. By the third act, the scene featured the Golden Boy and Jade Maiden, a banner and a screen, followed by a petite dan (actress) in a delicate feathered costume, with a black scarf over her head, singing a few lines before disappearing backstage. No one fully understood, but a voice from outside said, “This is an excerpt from the newly composed ‘Rui Zhu Ji’—‘Ming Sheng.’ The petite dan portrays Chang’e, who, having fallen from grace, was nearly married off; fortunately, Guanyin’s intervention saved her, and she passed on before she could wed. Now she ascends to the lunar palace. Didn’t the song say, ‘On earth they only speak of fleeting passions—who knows that autumn moons and spring blossoms are easily forsaken? How can one not remember the vast Cold Palace?’” The fourth act was “Eating Bran,” and the fifth featured Bodhidharma escorting his disciples across a river in a mirage-like spectacle, full of bustling excitement. While everyone was in high spirits, suddenly, people from the Xue family burst in, drenched in sweat, and rushed up to Xue Ke, saying, “Second Master, hurry back! Also, take the mistress inside and return immediately—there is urgent business at home.” Xue Ke asked, “What matter?” A family member replied, “Just wait until you get home and ask.” Xue Ke, not even having time to explain, departed.
You’d better leave those trivial matters alone!” Zhao Yiniang fell silent. Eventually, Li Zhi and Tan Chun confessed everything to Madam Wang. Madam Wang, moved to tears, decided to call Jia Mu back and to consult with Lady Xing about these people who had come. Meanwhile, even Feng Jie, though ill, had heard that Baoyu’s jade was lost. Knowing that Madam Wang was on her way, and that she could no longer hide, Feng Jie, with a timid air, took Feng’er and came into the garden. Just as Madam Wang was rising to leave, Feng Jie timidly said, “Please greet Madam.” Baoyu and the others went over to inquire after Feng Jie’s well-being. Madam Wang then said, “You’ve heard it too, haven’t you? Isn’t this an extraordinary matter? First, it seemed you couldn’t see it, and now it’s lost—if it cannot be found. Think about it: from the time you summoned the maids from the old lady’s side to those of you in Ping’er’s group, whose hands are not trembling and whose hearts are not scheming? When I report back to the old lady, I must get to the bottom of it. Otherwise, it will be as though Baoyu’s lifeline has been severed!”  Feng Jie replied, “In our family, there are too many meddling hands. As the saying goes, ‘You know the face but not the heart.’ How can anyone be sure of who is honest? Once a fuss breaks out, everyone will know. Whoever stole the jade must be identified by Madam. Knowing full well that such a person is doomed, they might even destroy evidence to silence themselves. What then? In my muddled thinking, I believe that Baoyu never really cared for it; if he lost it, it is nothing serious. Provided we are discreet, and do not let the old lady or the old master know, then all will be well.”  Madam Wang paused for a moment before saying, “Though your words have merit, how can we keep such a secret from the old master?” She then ordered Huan’er, “Regarding your Second Brother’s jade being lost, why did you start shouting so recklessly? If you make too much noise and they destroy it, I fear you won’t live to regret it!”  Huan’er, terrified, cried, “I won’t shout anymore!” Zhao Yiniang, hearing this, dared not utter another word. Madam Wang then instructed everyone, “Surely there must be some place outside where it wasn’t found. It was safely kept at home—how could it possibly have flown off? But you must not let this be publicized. Xiren, you have three days to find it. If it is not found within three days, I’m afraid the secret won’t last, and we’ll all be in for no peaceful days!” With that, she called Feng Jie to go over to Lady Xing’s side to discuss the matter quietly. At this point, Li Wan and the others began discussing among themselves, and they summoned all the garden attendants. They ordered the garden gates to be locked and sent word to the Lin Zhi Xiao family, instructing them secretly to inform their head of household: “Order the front and back gates to be manned; for three days, no servant or any person—male or female—is allowed to leave. Only if something is lost inside, and once it is recovered, may people be let out.” The Lin family agreed, saying “Yes,” and added, “Not long ago, one of our servants lost something of little value. Lin Zhi Xiao must understand that, once a diviner named Liu Tiezui is consulted on the street—he divined a character that was very clear—upon returning and searching accordingly, it was found.”  Xiren, upon hearing this, earnestly entreated the Lin family, “Dear Lin Grandma, please go quickly and ask Lin Da Ye on our behalf.” The Lin family agreed and departed. Lady Xing then remarked, “If that diviner who reads characters is incompetent, I once heard in the south that Miaoyu can perform spirit writing—why not trouble her to ask? Moreover, I’ve heard that this jade originally possessed some celestial quality; perhaps she can divine it out.” Everyone was astonished, “We’ve never heard of that before.”  Mesha quickly asked Xiuyan, “I suppose others who consult him are turned away.
At that time, he could not eat anything, so he sent for some small side dishes.” I explained to the old lady that since she was not in the room, I couldn’t intervene, so I told him, “The old lady isn’t available right now; when she returns, she will be informed.” And I sent him on his way. Just then, when I heard mention of the southern dishes, I remembered them—lest we forget.”  Sister Feng paused in astonishment and said, “The southern side dishes are still available—have someone send them over. As for the silver, wait until Brother Qin comes tomorrow to collect it.”  Then Xiao Hong entered and announced, “Just now Second Master sent word that he has urgent business outside the city tonight and cannot return—please notify everyone accordingly.”  Sister Feng replied, “That’s right.”  While they were talking, a little maid came panting from the back, running into the courtyard. Outside, Ping’er and several other maidservants were chattering nervously. Sister Feng asked, “What are you all saying?”  Ping’er replied, “One of the little maids, trembling with fear, said she heard voices like a clamor coming from three empty rooms in the back—like the sound of cats or mice or even someone venting anger. She got so frightened that she ran back.”  Sister Feng scolded, “Nonsense! I won’t have you spreading ghost stories. I never believe such superstitions—now get out of here!”  The little maid scurried away. Sister Feng then called Cai Ming to go over the daily miscellaneous accounts. It was already nearly the second watch of the night. After a brief rest and some idle chatter, everyone was told to retire. Sister Feng herself then went to sleep. Approaching the third watch, Sister Feng seemed unable to sleep. Feeling a sudden chill running down her spine, she awoke more and more agitated. She called Ping’er and Qiu Tong to keep her company. The two were puzzled by her mood. Originally, Qiu Tong had not been on good terms with Sister Feng, but after Jia Lian’s affair with You Er (the Second Sister) diminished his favor for Qiu Tong, and Sister Feng began to court him, Qiu Tong had grown quieter—though her heart remained more troubled than Ping’er’s. Seeing that Sister Feng was distraught, Qiu Tong brought some tea. Sister Feng sipped it and said, “Thank you, but go back to sleep; it is enough if Ping’er stays here.”  Qiu Tong, wishing to be of service, said, “If the old lady can’t sleep, perhaps the two of us should take turns keeping watch.” Sister Feng murmured a few words and then fell asleep. When Ping’er and Qiu Tong later saw that Sister Feng had indeed fallen asleep, they heard a distant crowing of a rooster. The two quickly dressed and arose to attend to Sister Feng’s grooming. Sister Feng, still in a daze from her nocturnal disturbances, insisted on getting up. As she sat pondering, a little maid from the courtyard called out, “Is Miss Ping’er in the room?” Ping’er answered in the affirmative. The little maid then lifted the curtain and entered—it was the one sent by Madam Wang to fetch Jia Lian, saying, “There is urgent official business outside. The Master has just left, and the Mistress has sent word to quickly summon Second Master.”  Sister Feng was startled. To be continued… Chapter 89: When the Deceased Remain but Their Possessions Live On—The Young Master Composes Verses for the Orphan, While the Family’s Strict Customs Lead Jia Zhen to Flog a Recalcitrant Servant  It happened that Sister Feng (Fengjie) was just rousing herself from sleep in a state of puzzlement when a little maid’s voice startled her. The maid hastily asked, “What is the official matter?” The little maid replied, “I don’t know exactly. Just now a junior servant at the Second Gate reported that Master has urgent official business, so the Mistress ordered that Second Master be summoned.” Upon hearing news concerning the Ministry of Works, Fengjie’s heart eased a little. She said, “Go back and tell the Mistress that Second Master did not return last night because he had affairs outside the city—send word that he was dispatched to see Brother Zhen first.” The maid agreed and hurried off.
“This jade was born with me—it is no ordinary object, and its comings and goings are fated. If this flower is to herald good fortune, surely the jade should not be lost. Perhaps this unusual blooming portends misfortune—could it be that something ominous is about to occur?” she murmured, and her heart grew heavy. In her alternating moods of sorrow and joy, she finally dozed off around the fifth watch. The next day, Madam Wang and the others sent people early to the pawnshops to inquire, and Fengjie secretly sought it as well. For several days, the matter was all the rage, yet the jade remained unfound. Neither Jia Mu nor Jia Zheng knew the news. Each day, Xiren and the others lived in constant anxiety. Baoyu himself stayed away from his studies for days on end—he was distant, silent, and listless. Madam Wang knew only that his condition had worsened ever since the loss of the jade, but did not pay it much heed. Then, one day, while Madam Wang was pondering matters, Jia Lian entered to pay his respects, grinning and saying, “Today I heard from Yucun that our Second Master’s household received word from Uncle’s side: our great-uncle has been promoted to Grand Academician of the Cabinet and is en route to the capital. It’s been decreed that on the 20th day of the first month of next year, the official announcement will be made—with 300 li worth of documents sent over. They say our great-uncle will travel day and night, and in a little over half a month he shall arrive. I came here to inform Madam.” Madam Wang, upon hearing this, was overjoyed. Thinking that while her own family’s numbers were sparse, the Xue Aunt’s family was in decline, and her brothers were scattered afar with no one to rely on—suddenly, with a brother taking office in the capital, the Wang family’s glory would be restored, and Baoyu would have support. Thus, her concern over the lost jade was eased, and daily her mind turned to awaiting her brother’s arrival in the capital. Then, unexpectedly one day, Jia Zheng entered with a face streaked with tears, panting as he said, “Quick, inform the old lady—go immediately into the palace! You alone shall serve there. The Empress Dowager’s condition has suddenly worsened. Now the eunuchs are waiting outside. They say, ‘The Imperial Hospital has already reported severe phlegm-induced collapse—there is no cure.’” Madam Wang burst into tears upon hearing this. Jia Zheng said, “This is no time for tears. Go at once to summon the old lady. Speak in a gentle manner so as not to startle her.” As Jia Zheng spoke, he stepped out to instruct the family to attend to matters. Madam Wang wiped her tears and went to fetch Jia Mu, telling him only that the Yuan Consort was gravely ill and that she must pay her respects in the palace. Jia Mu chanted Buddhist prayers, “How is it that she is ill again? Previously, I was terribly frightened, and then it turned out to be a misunderstanding. If I must be mistaken again, so be it.” Madam Wang, while answering, hurried Yuanyang and others to open the chest of garments and adornments so that the old lady might dress quickly. After hastily preparing her own attire, Madam Wang went to serve in the palace. In short, the procession left without further mention. Meanwhile, after Yuan Chun was selected to reside in the Fengzao Palace, she enjoyed the imperial favor and, with her health robust, nonetheless found her movements laborious. Daily she was worn out by the rigors of court life, and periodically suffered from phlegm troubles. After returning from a banquet in the palace the previous day, she had caught a chill that reawakened an old ailment. Alas, this time it turned grave: her phlegm became so obstructed that her limbs grew cold. Despite immediate memorials and summons for the royal physicians, neither the prescribed medicines nor even the potent ‘tongguan’ remedies had any effect. The palace officials, in their anxiety, petitioned that preparations be made for her final rites. An imperial edict was issued, summoning the Jia family from the Pepper Chamber for an audience. Jia Mu and Madam Wang, following the order, entered the palace and saw that Yuan Consort, with phlegm clogging her throat and drooling, could not speak.
Bao Yu walked quietly behind the rockery listening. He heard one person remark, “Look, is he coming up or not?” in a tone reminiscent of Li Wen’s speech. Another laughed, “Good—he’s coming down; I know he won’t come up.” That voice was none other than Tan Chun’s. Then another said, “Yes, she is coming up.” These last two were the voices of Li Qi and Xing Xiuyan. Unable to resist, Bao Yu picked up a small brick and threw it into the water with a splash. The sound startled all four, and they exclaimed, “Who threw that so suddenly? That nearly scared us to death!” Bao Yu leaped out from behind the rockery with a laugh and called, “You all are so amusing! Why didn’t you call out to me?” Tan Chun said, “I knew it wasn’t anyone else—it must be our second elder brother being mischievous. There’s nothing to say; just compensate us for our lost fish. Earlier, a fish came up; it was about to be caught, but you scared it away.” Bao Yu laughed, “Since you’re playing here and didn’t call for me, now I must punish you!” Everyone laughed. Bao Yu then declared, “Let us fish today and see whose luck is best! Whoever catches a fish, their fortune is good this year; if not, then their luck is poor. Who shall cast first?” Tan Chun suggested, “Let Li Wen go first,” but Li Wen refused. Tan Chun laughed, “Then I shall cast first,” and turned to Bao Yu, “Second master, if you drive away my fish, I shall not abide it.” Bao Yu replied, “I intended only to startle you all for fun; now go ahead and fish.” Tan Chun cast the line, and in a few moments a small fish swallowed the hook along with the bobber. Tan Chun lifted his rod from the ground—so lively! An attendant scrambled across, gathering the fish and placing them in a small porcelain basin filled with clear water. Tan Chun then handed the rod to Li Wen. Li Wen cast his line, but when he felt the string move, he quickly reeled it in—only to find it empty. After trying again for a while, the line moved, and he reeled it in once more—still an empty hook. Inspecting the hook, Li Wen discovered he had indeed caught something. Laughing, he said, “Brother Bao, you have caught something.” Bao Yu said, “Then let Third Sister and Fourth Sister fish, and I will fish later.” Xiuyan remained silent. Soon Li Qi said, “Brother Bao, you fish first.” As a bobber emerged from the water, Tan Chun remarked, “There’s no need to yield completely. Look, the fish are gathered near Third Sister’s area—let her fish quickly.” Li Qi then took the rod and, as soon as it sank, caught a fish. Then Xiuyan fished and caught one, and soon passed the rod to Tan Chun, who then handed it to Bao Yu. Bao Yu declared, “I wish to be like Jiang Taigong,” and proceeded to sit by the pond on a rock outcrop and began fishing. But the fish, upon seeing him, scattered away, and Bao Yu swung his rod for a long time—the line remaining motionless. When a fish eventually surfaced, Bao Yu waggled his rod and scared it off. Frustrated, he said, “I am naturally impatient, yet he is slow—what shall I do? Come on, good fish, do me a favor!” which made all four laugh. Before long, the fishing line stirred slightly. Overjoyed, Bao Yu mustered his strength, scooped up the line, but when his rod struck a rock it broke in two, the line snapping and the hook disappearing. Everyone laughed even harder. Tan Chun said, “I’ve never seen anyone as clumsy as you!”  Just then, Mosyue rushed in in a panic and said, “Second master, Grandmother has awakened—she’s calling for you!” All five were startled. Tan Chun then asked Mosyue, “What does Grandmother want?” Mosyue replied, “I don’t know.
Everyone’s hair stood on end. Jia Zhen, though partially awakened by his fright—and managing better than the others—felt deeply alarmed, and after sitting for a while, reluctantly returned to his room to rest. The next morning, being the fifteenth day, he led his sons and nephews to perform the ancestral rite for the new moon. A careful inspection of the ancestral hall revealed that everything was as it had always been, with no odd signs whatsoever. Jia Zhen blamed himself for his drunken folly but did not mention the matter further. After the rites, the doors were closed and locked up as usual. That evening, after dinner, Jia Zhen and his wife came to the Rong Mansion. They found that Jia She and Jia Zheng were sitting in Grandmother Jia’s room, chatting and teasing her. Jia Lian, Bao Yu, Jia Huan, and Jia Lan all stood as attendants below. When Jia Zhen arrived, everyone greeted him one by one and exchanged a few words; only then did he settle on a small stool near the door, sitting sideways. Grandmother Jia smiled and asked, “How are your brothers’ arrows these days?” Jia Zhen quickly rose and replied with a smile, “They have made great progress—both in appearance and in that the bows have gained extra strength.” Grandmother Jia said, “That will do; do not overstrain, but be careful.” Jia Zhen quickly responded with several “Yes, indeed.” Grandmother Jia then remarked, “The mooncakes you sent yesterday are very good. The watermelon looks promising, yet when cut open it isn’t quite as impressive.” Jia Zhen smiled and said, “The mooncakes are from a new pastry chef; I tested them and they were indeed excellent, so I dared to prepare them as a filial offering. As for the watermelon, in previous years it was fine; I wonder why this year it is not as good.” Jia Zheng commented, “Perhaps it is due to the excessive rain this year.” Grandmother Jia laughed, “Now that the moon has risen, let us go and offer incense.” With that, she rose, assisted Bao Yu by the shoulder, and led everyone out into the garden. At that moment the main gate of the garden was flung wide open, with goat-horn lanterns hanging. On the Yuetai of Jiayin Hall, incense was being burned, candles held aloft, and fruits, mooncakes, and other items were displayed. Mrs. Xing and the others had been waiting inside for a long time. The scene was indescribably splendid—bright lanterns, fragrant incense, and a resplendent, hazy aura filled the air. On the ground lay embroidered mats for worship. After Grandmother Jia finished her incense offering, everyone bowed. Grandmother Jia then said, “The best place for moon-gazing is atop the hill.” She then ordered that the grand hall on the hill be prepared, and upon hearing this, everyone hurried to arrange it there. Grandmother Jia herself stayed in Jiayin Hall to drink tea and chat idly for a while. Soon someone announced, “Everything is ready.” Then Grandmother Jia, leaning on an attendant’s shoulder, led everyone up the hill. Madame Wang and the others said, “I fear the stone on the hill may be slippery with moss; it would be better if we sat on bamboo chairs.” Grandmother Jia replied, “What harm is there in wearing a couple more layers? This is precisely the place for moon-viewing—how could we possibly not go?” Thus, Jia She, Jia Zheng, and the others led the way; two wives held horn-shaped handkerchiefs, while Yuan Yang, Hu Po, and Lady You assisted closely; Mrs. Xing and the rest followed behind. After a short, winding walk of no more than a hundred steps, they reached the ridge of the main peak, where an open hall stood. Because it was high on the ridge, the hall was named “Tubi Mountain Villa.” Before the hall, on a terrace, round tables and chairs were arranged; a large folding screen divided the space into two sections, and all the tables and chairs were circular, symbolizing family unity. In the center sat Grandmother Jia; to her left were Jia She, Jia Zhen, Jia Lian, and Jia Rong; to her right were Jia Zheng, Bao Yu, Jia Huan, and Jia Lan.
When he nearly drew a knife to kill, she stretched out her neck in defiance. Xue Pan, unable to bring himself to hit her, raged for a while before giving up. Over time, this became habitual, and it even led Jin Gui to increasingly insult Baochan. Baochan, who could not compare with Xiangling, was like dry tinder; having bonded with Xue Pan over shared feelings, he completely disregarded Jin Gui. Outraged by Jin Gui’s continual mistreatment, Baochan refused to back down. At first there were quarrels and shoving; later Jin Gui’s anger escalated to insults, and then even to physical blows. Though Baochan dared not fight back, he began to roll and flail about as if seeking death, both by day with knives and scissors, and by night with ropes – causing endless havoc. Xue Pan, caught between conflicting loyalties, stood helplessly by, thoroughly exasperated, and eventually left the house in despair. Jin Gui, meanwhile, secretly explained to Baochan that that very night Xue Pan was to “marry” in Qiu Ling’s room – that is, she was to be made to accompany Jin Gui in bed. At first Qiu Ling refused, but Jin Gui insisted, claiming that she was being too fastidious and that comfort was secondary to convenience in the dark of night. She scolded, “Have you not seen our master? He takes every opportunity to hoard his maidservants and won’t let you near – what is your plan? I fear you intend to drive me to ruin!” Xue Pan, fearing that this might ruin Baochan’s reputation, quickly returned and admonished Qiu Ling, “If you do not obey, I will beat you!” Qiu Ling, with no choice, had to gather her bedding and lie down on the floor, reluctantly obeying. No sooner had she laid down than she was summoned repeatedly for tea throughout the night, and her legs were pounded several times so that she could not rest for a moment. Xue Pan, having secured Baochan as if it were a treasure, ignored all else. In his bitterness, Jin Gui murmured, “Let him have his fun for a few days; once he grows distant, then I can arrange for Xiangling. Then Baochan, originally mine, will be useless.” Quietly enduring, she schemed to further manipulate Qiu Ling. After about half a month, Qiu Ling suddenly pretended to be ill, complaining of unbearable heartache and immobility with treatments proving ineffective. Everyone remarked that it was due to her suppressed anger. After two days, unexpectedly, someone discovered a paper effigy hidden among Jin Gui’s pillows – bearing her age and an inscription of eight characters, with five needles pinned into her heart area and the gaps between her ribs and limbs. Thus the household took this as news and reported it first to Aunt Xue. Aunt Xue, now frantic, and Xue Pan, even more disordered, threatened to interrogate everyone. Jin Gui said, “There is no need to wrong innocent people. It appears that Baochan’s ‘demon-repelling charm’ must be used.” Xue Pan replied, “But she has not spent much time in your room lately; why cling to a good woman?” Jin Gui sneered, “Who else is there? Am I not the only one? Even if there were others, who would dare enter my room?” Xue Pan said, “Now that Qiu Ling follows you every day, she surely knows; question her and you will find out.” Jin Gui laughed coldly, “Question whom? Who will confess? In my view, they will all feign ignorance—so let it drop. Besides, even if I were to be punished to death, it matters little; I could always remarry someone better. Truly, if you complain, who will not blame me?” Bursting into tears, she continued, “Then why must you drag everyone into this? I fear I will be blamed if you persist.” Xue Pan’s anger mounted, and he snatched up a door bolt, stormed off, and without further ado confronted Qiu Ling, accusing her directly. Qiu Ling cried out in protest. Aunt Xue rushed in and commanded, “Do not start beating before you understand the whole story! This maidservant has served for years—was it not that she was careless once? Would you really do something so heartless? Ask clearly first, then act!” Hearing his mother’s words, Jin Gui feared Xue Pan might soften, and she began to cry bitterly, “For half a month you have monopolized my Baochan, kept her from entering my room, and only allowed Qiu Ling to sleep with me.
Better that we settle for less rather than cause further embarrassment.” Then she ordered Ping’er, “Take my gold ornaments and pledge them for two hundred taels of silver to be sent off to settle the matter.”  Jia Lian remarked, “Might as well pledge an extra two hundred—we need to show our determination.”  Feng Xifeng replied, “No need—I have no use for it. I’m not even sure which item is to be redeemed.”  Ping’er took the order and instructed Wang’er’s wife to handle it. Soon enough, silver was procured and Jia Lian personally delivered it—this matter needing no further comment. At that moment, Feng Xifeng and Ping’er began to discuss those who might be spreading rumors. “It’s not as if we want Yuanyang to be inconvenienced—surely this is our fault!” they muttered. Just then someone announced, “The Mistress has arrived!”  Feng Xifeng, startled and uncertain of what was happening, quickly and anxiously went out with Ping’er to greet the Mistress. Meanwhile, Wang Furen’s face had grown stern; she entered accompanied only by a maid and, without a word, went into the inner room. Feng Xifeng quickly offered tea and, trying to maintain a smiling facade, asked, “Madam, are you in good spirits today? Have you come to take a stroll?”  Wang Furen curtly commanded, “Ping’er, go out!”  Ping’er, taken aback, immediately replied and led several young maids outside, standing by the door while closing it behind them. Then, she herself sat on the steps, ensuring no one could re-enter. Feng Xifeng, seeing this, grew anxious and asked, “Madam, what is the matter?”  Wang Furen, tearfully, reached into her sleeve and tossed out a perfumed sachet, exclaiming, “Look!”  Feng Xifeng quickly picked it up; it was a richly embroidered, multicolored ‘Spring Joy’ sachet. Shocked, she asked, “Madam, where did you get this?”  Wang Furen, trembling and weeping even more, replied, “Where did I get it? I was sitting by the well—and I thought you were as attentive as I am! But it seems that in broad daylight this item was found by one of Grandmother’s maids on a rock in the garden. Before you know it, it would have been delivered to Grandmother. Tell me, how did it come to be there?”  Feng Xifeng, now even more flustered, asked, “Madam, how can you be certain it’s mine?”  Wang Furen, crying and lamenting, said, “How can I tell? Aside from you, what other women in our household would dare possess such an item? It is said that if a young lady is seen with this, even servants would not miss it. If any maid were to find it and then let it be known, our reputation would be ruined!”  Feng Xifeng, overcome with both anger and shame, lowered her face and knelt at the step, weeping quietly as she confided, “Madam, I truly never intended for this to happen. That very sachet was a copy made from outside—its tassels and all were market-bought. Though I am young and do not consider myself haughty, I would never display such things openly. Even if I possessed one, I would keep it hidden in private; I could not possibly wear it for all to see. Besides, if it were to appear in the garden where all our sisters mingle, not only would they see it, but so would the servants—what meaning would that have? Moreover, even if I had one, I would only use it privately. You, as a refined young lady, must understand.”  Wang Furen’s eyes filled with tears as she listened. Overcome, she ordered Feng Xifeng to rise. Meanwhile, Jia Lian appeared and, after a few exchanges, Feng Xifeng confided privately that she had to borrow silver for a matter involving “Liu Jin Feng.” Jia Lian grinned and said, “Tell me, what’s the matter?”  Feng Xifeng explained that earlier, while discussing with others, someone had accused Liu Er Xifu and her sister of colluding during their gambling sessions, claiming that everything the younger sister did was done under her direction.
Besides, even if I were to be punished to death, it matters little; I could always remarry someone better. Truly, if you complain, who will not blame me?” With tears streaming down, she continued, “Then why must you involve everyone? I fear I will be blamed if you persist.” Xue Pan’s anger mounted further, and he seized a door bolt, stormed off, and without further ado confronted Qiu Ling, accusing her bluntly. Qiu Ling cried out in protest. Aunt Xue rushed in and commanded, “Do not start beating her until you know the whole truth! This maidservant has served for years—wasn’t there a time when she made a mistake? Would you really be so heartless? Ask clearly first, then act!” Hearing this, Jin Gui feared that Xue Pan might soften and began to weep bitterly, “For half a month you have monopolized my Baochan, kept her from entering my room, and only allowed Qiu Ling to sleep with me. I wish to question Baochan, yet you continue protecting him. Now you act so defiantly as to beat her—if you kill me, then remarry as you please; why must you put on this farce?” Xue Pan’s anger grew even more. Aunt Xue, seeing how her daughter-in-law oppressed her son, cursed bitterly. In her fury she ordered, “Sell Xiangling immediately!” Miss Bao then laughed, “Our family only knows how to buy people, not sell them—madam, you are completely confused. If word gets out, won’t it be a laughingstock? If my elder brother and sister-in-law despise her and leave her to me, I’m doomed!” Aunt Xue replied, “Better to dismiss her entirely than allow her to remain with us.” Miss Bao laughed, “Whether she stays with me or not is immaterial—cut her off as if she were sold.” Xiangling had already run up to Aunt Xue, pleading bitterly and crying, unwilling to leave; she wished instead to remain with the young lady. Aunt Xue, with no alternative, had to relent. Thereafter, Xiangling left with Miss Bao, effectively severing her ties with the past. Yet she could not help but feel sorrow beneath the moonlight, and by lamplight she quietly lamented. Although she had spent several years in Xue Pan’s household, her delicate condition – worsened by her inherent illness – meant she never bore children; now, further aggravated by anger and distress, her health declined, and she eventually developed a “dry blood” disorder, growing thinner and losing her appetite with no remedy proving effective. Meanwhile, Jin Gui continued to quarrel with Xue Pan. On occasion, emboldened by wine, he confronted her twice. When he tried to strike with a stick, Jin Gui dodged and ordered him away. When he nearly drew a knife, she stretched out her neck defiantly. Unable to bring himself to hit her, Xue Pan raged for a while before giving up. In time, this became habitual, and Jin Gui’s insults to Baochan grew ever more severe. Baochan, who could not compare with Xiangling, was like dry tinder; having bonded with Xue Pan through shared sentiments, he completely disregarded Jin Gui. Outraged by her continual mistreatment, Baochan refused to relent. At first there were verbal spats and shoving; later Jin Gui’s anger escalated to physical blows. Though Baochan dared not retaliate, he began to thrash about as if courting death – by day with knives and scissors, by night with ropes – causing endless commotion. Xue Pan, caught between loyalties he could not resolve, eventually stood helplessly by, thoroughly exasperated, and left the house in despair. Jin Gui, meanwhile, secretly explained to Baochan that that very night Xue Pan was to be “married” in Qiu Ling’s room – meaning she was to be forced to accompany him in bed. At first Qiu Ling refused, but Jin Gui insisted that she must not be overly particular about comfort in the dark hours. She scolded, “Have you not seen our master? He clutches his maidservants so tightly that none may approach you – what is your plan? I fear you intend to drive me to ruin!” Worried that this might ruin Baochan’s reputation, Xue Pan quickly returned and admonished Qiu Ling, “If you do not obey, I will beat you!” With no alternative, Qiu Ling had to gather her bedding and lie down on the floor, reluctantly obeying.
Hurry and settle this matter, and then take care of the rest of our household affairs.” Hearing this, Zhou Ruijia gathered the several wives from that side, went first into Yingchun’s room, and reported the news to Yingchun. Hearing it, Yingchun, with tearful reluctance, recalled the previous night’s incident. Though the bonds of affection had lasted for many years, the matter of propriety could not be helped. Si Qi had even pleaded with Yingchun, hoping to be rescued, but Yingchun, slow of speech and gentle of heart, was unable to decide. Si Qi, seeing this, knew escape was impossible; she kneeled and cried, “Sister, how cruel you are! After comforting me for these past two days, how is it that you now have nothing to say?” Zhou Ruijia said, “Do you expect the sister to keep you forever? If you remain, it will be hard for you to meet anyone in the garden. In my honest opinion, quickly pack up and leave—disappear quietly so that everyone may maintain their dignity.” Hearing this, Yingchun, who had been reading a book, put it aside without answering, simply twisting her body in silent despair. Zhou Ruijia then urged, “You, a grown girl, should know better! How can you let the maidservants treat you so poorly? You still cling to her!” Yingchun finally spoke, “Don’t you see, I have known her for years—how could it be that as soon as she is gone everything falls apart? Naturally, it is not just the two of you; I believe everyone in the garden will eventually leave. In my view, sooner or later everything must be dispersed. Let each one go their own way.” Zhou Ruijia replied, “That is exactly what you understand. Tomorrow, there will be more people sent; rest assured.” Si Qi, with tears in her eyes, had no choice but to kowtow to Yingchun and bid farewell to everyone. She then whispered to Yingchun, “Even if you try to plead my case, please at least mention it on my behalf – even if it is only a small favor.” Yingchun replied tearfully, “Rest assured.” Thus, Zhou Ruijia and his group took Si Qi out. Two old women then gathered all of Si Qi’s belongings and handed them over to her. After only a few steps, they saw Xiu Ju, already wiping away tears, who handed Si Qi a small silk pouch and said, “This is from your sister – as a token of our shared fate. Since we must eventually part, take this as a memento.” Si Qi accepted it and burst into even deeper tears, crying together with Xiu Ju once more. Impatient, Zhou Ruijia urged, and the two finally dispersed. Si Qi, still sobbing, pleaded, “Please, dear aunts, show me some compassion. Let me go and bid farewell to my dear friend sister – after all, for these years we have been close.” Zhou Ruijia and his companions, all occupied with their own tasks, replied scornfully, “I advise you to leave; do not dither! We have serious matters to attend to. Who do you think you are, crawling out from your own garment? Why must you say farewell to them? You’ll only be delayed for a little while—does that count for nothing?” Irritated, he said, “Hurry up and go!” As he spoke, he led her out the rear corner gate. Unable to protest further, Si Qi followed. Just then, Bao Yu, returning from outside, saw that Si Qi was being led out with many belongings; he suspected that she was being sent away for good. Hearing the nighttime events and that Qingwen’s illness had worsened that day, he asked Qingwen in detail—but she would not say why. Now, seeing Si Qi departing, Bao Yu, overcome with grief as if he had lost his soul, hurried to stop them and asked, “Where are you going?” Zhou Ruijia and the others, well aware of Bao Yu’s past behavior and fearing that prying might cause further trouble, laughed and said, “It is none of your business—hurry and study.” Bao Yu, laughing nervously, said, “Sisters, please wait a moment—I have something to say.” Zhou Ruijia retorted, “Madame has ordered that you must not waste time. What reason could you possibly have?
I immediately reported it to the constable and informed his mother. I don’t know exactly how they fought; I beg the magistrate to question the man who was drinking.” The magistrate bellowed, “You claimed you saw it yourself during the initial inquiry—now you say you didn’t!” Li Er stammered, “I was in a state of shock and ended up speaking incoherently.” At this, the constables shouted again. The magistrate then called Wu Liang and demanded, “Were you present when you all were drinking together? How did Xue Pan strike him? Tell the truth!” Wu Liang replied, “I was at home that day. Our eldest uncle, Xue Da Ye, invited me to drink. When he found the wine unsatisfactory and demanded a change, Zhang San refused. Enraged, our eldest uncle splashed wine in his face—and somehow the wine bowl hit his head. I witnessed it all with my own eyes.” The magistrate retorted, “Nonsense! At the mortuary the other day, Xue Pan himself admitted to having smashed the bowl. Yet you claim you saw it with your own eyes—your testimony does not match! Spank him!” The constables raised their arms as if to strike Wu Liang. Wu Liang pleaded, “Xue Pan never intended to fight with Zhang San—he merely splashed wine at him because Zhang San refused to have his wine replaced. In a moment of carelessness, the bowl accidentally struck his head. I beg you, question Xue Pan; he is a man of grace!” The magistrate then summoned Xue Pan and asked, “What exactly was your grievance with Zhang San? How did he die? Confess truthfully!” Xue Pan said, “I beg your pardon, Your Honor. I did not set out to fight him. I only splashed wine at him because he refused to have his wine replaced. I did not intend to hit him; it was a misfortune—a careless accident. In a panic, I tried to staunch his bleeding, but when I realized that I could not stem the flow and his blood was gushing, he died shortly thereafter. At the mortuary the other day, fearing Your Honor’s anger, I claimed that I had smashed the bowl on him. I only beg for your mercy!” The magistrate roared, “You muddle-brained fellow! First you claim you hit him because he wouldn’t change his wine, and now you claim it was an accidental blow! Enough with your shifting stories!” Feigning a show of force as if to beat him further, the magistrate ordered the coroner to “fill out the injury report exactly as observed at the mortuary.” The coroner reported, “Upon examination the other day, Zhang San’s body showed no bruises except for a mark at the fontanel area measuring approximately 1.7 inches long and 0.5 inch deep, with the skin split open. The fontanel bone was fragile and had a break over about 0.3 inches. It appears to have been a bump injury.” The magistrate compared the wound with the testimony, and, had the documents not already been revised to be lenient, would have pressed further. Instead, he hastily ordered that the testimony be recorded. Zhang Wang cried out, “Good heavens, Your Honor! I recall there being more injuries—how come now there’s only this one?” The magistrate replied, “This woman is talking nonsense! Look at the wound you see here—don’t you understand?” He then called upon Zhang Er, saying, “Tell me, how many injuries did you notice on your nephew’s body?” Zhang Er hastily replied, “There was one injury on his head.” The magistrate pressed, “There is more!” He then summoned a clerk to show Zhang Wang the injury report and asked the constable and Zhang Er to confirm it. “As you see, the witnesses at the mortuary all testified that there was no fight; it was merely an accidental injury. The instructions were simply to record it as such. Xue Pan is to be held in custody for further investigation. The rest of the witnesses are to be dismissed.” Zhang Wang wailed and ranted, but the magistrate ordered the constables to drive her out. Zhang Er then consoled her, “It was truly an accident—how can you pin the blame on someone else? Now that Your Honor has made his ruling, cease your clamor.” Outside, Xue Ke received word of the verdict and was secretly pleased. He sent a messenger home with a letter, stating that once the full approval arrived, they could make arrangements for his brother’s redemption and secure his release.
Madam Xue immediately called a young maid to fetch Baochai so they could read the letter together. The letter read as follows:  “The silver has been used to cover the official fees at the county office. My brother, though in custody, is not suffering greatly—please do reassure the mistress. However, the officials here are very exacting; even the close relatives acting as witnesses refuse to cooperate, and even the friend our brother called upon is assisting them. Since Li Xiang and I are native-born, we were fortunate to find a gentleman who, for a sum of silver, has offered us a plan. He suggests that if we can coerce Wu Liang—who was drinking with our brother that very night—to testify, and offer him some silver to ‘tear up’ the confession, then if he refuses, we can blame the death on a certain Zhang San, an outsider. If Wu Liang cannot stomach it, then all will be settled. I followed his advice, and sure enough, Wu Liang came forward. Now, a witness has been arranged and another memorial has been drafted; it was submitted the day before yesterday and approved today. Please see the memorial for details.” And the memorial continued with these words: “I, the undersigned, hereby present this petition concerning my brother’s tragic misfortune and the redress of his grievance: My dear blood-brother, Xue Pan, originally from Nanjing but residing in the Western Capital, departed on business down south on [a certain date]. Not long after, a family servant delivered a letter saying that he had been ‘killed’—and he immediately rushed to the authorities. Upon arrival in prison, our brother tearfully confessed that he had accidentally injured a man surnamed Zhang. In the ensuing interrogations, he insisted that he had never harbored any enmity against Zhang; indeed, the two had no prior grudge. It happened by chance at a wine-drinking quarrel when, as our brother flung down his wine, Zhang San happened to be bending over to pick something up; in that moment, the wine bowl accidentally struck his head, causing his death. Fearing punishment, our brother, under duress, admitted that a fight had broken out. In his plea for mercy, he has cited the Emperor’s benevolence; however, no verdict has yet been reached. With our brother still in confinement, I now submit this statement on his behalf, risking life and limb. I humbly beg for the Emperor’s gracious favor in allowing a formal re-examination of the evidence. Our entire family shall remain forever in your debt.” The ruling read: “The post-mortem examination of the corpse has confirmed the evidence beyond doubt. Moreover, no torture was administered, and your brother himself confessed to the fight leading to death. Since you are far removed from the incident and did not witness it, you cannot be expected to fabricate evidence. According to the law, he should be convicted. However, taking into account your brother’s plight, we shall be lenient. Case closed—petition denied.” Upon hearing these words, Madam Xue exclaimed, “Isn’t this hopeless? How can this be acceptable?” Baochai interjected, “You haven’t finished reading the rest of Second Brother’s letter yet; there’s more.” Then she recited further: “The matter hinges on one crucial question; further inquiries will reveal everything.” Madam Xue then questioned the messenger, “So what is it they want?” He replied, “The county has known for some time that our family’s assets are ample. They require us to secure an influential position in the capital and present an even larger gift, so that the case may be reexamined and our brother’s sentence lightened. The mistress must act quickly—any further delay might result in our eldest uncle suffering unduly.” Hearing this, Madam Xue sent the junior servant off once more to explain the situation to the Jia household by way of Madame Wang, earnestly pleading with Jia Zheng. Jia Zheng would only agree to have his acquaintances intercede with the county magistrate, and he refused to mention any money. Fearing that this would prove ineffective, Madam Xue sought help from Sister Feng and Jia Lian, spending several thousand silver taels to bribe the county magistrate. Soon, Xue Ke’s side also managed to reach an understanding. The county magistrate then posted notice and held court. He assembled all the local constables, witnesses, and relatives acting as forensic experts, and had Xue Pan brought from prison. In the interrogation room, each was asked by name. The magistrate then called the constable to recount the initial testimony, and also summoned Zhang Wang (a relative acting as a witness) along with his uncle Zhang Er for questioning.
Later, when Xue Ke was seen blowing out his lamp and falling asleep, Jin Gui returned to observe and report to Jin Gui—planning his next move. Meanwhile, Jin Gui left behind only the wine jug as a pretext for future encounters. Not long after, Baochai’s mother and daughter noted that Jin Gui had become unusually quiet and even affable in recent days—a stark contrast to his earlier behavior. At home, even Madam Xue was delighted, thinking, “Surely this must be because when Xue Pan married, he transgressed somehow and ruined these past few years. Now that everything has come to light, thanks to our wealth and the Jia family’s efforts, there is hope. Perhaps his luck will finally turn.” Madam Xue secretly rejoiced. That afternoon, after dinner, Madam Xue, accompanied by Tonggui, went to visit Jin Gui’s residence. In the courtyard they heard a man speaking with Jin Gui. Ever perceptive, Tonggui remarked, “Aunt, the Mistress has arrived.” When they reached the door, a shadow slipped away behind the room. Startled, Madam Xue recoiled. Jin Gui explained, “This is my adopted elder brother; he usually lives in the village and is unaccustomed to seeing visitors. He only came today because he had not met the Mistress before, and thus hadn’t yet greeted her.”  Madam Xue said, “Since he is an uncle, he should be allowed to meet her.”  Jin Gui called his brother out, and after bowing and exchanging greetings, Madam Xue inquired, “When did you come to the capital?”  The man replied, “Last month, when my mother had no one to manage the household, I was adopted and brought here just the other day to see my elder sister.”  Seeing that he bore no shame, Madam Xue invited him to sit. After a brief chat, she rose and said, “Stay here and have your meal before you depart.” The man consented, and Madam Xue then took her leave. Jin Gui then said to his brother, “Sit down. Today, since we have passed the gate, we have spared Second Master further trouble. I must also instruct you to purchase a few items—be careful that no one sees you.”  His brother replied, “Leave that to me. Whatever you require, if there is money, I can procure it.”  Jin Gui retorted, “Enough of your chatter; once you’ve made the purchase, I won’t accept them.” The two teased one another for a while, and then Jin Gui accompanied his brother to dinner. Later, he reminded him again about the purchase and gave further instructions before his brother departed. From then on, his visits became frequent, though an elderly doorman—who recognized him as an adopted uncle—rarely saw him return. Thus began an endless series of troubles—a story for another time. One day, a letter from Xue Pan arrived at Madam Xue’s residence. When she opened it and showed it to Baochai, it read:    “Though my life in the county is not overly burdened, Mother, please do not worry. However, yesterday the county’s scribes reported that our case had been approved for further inquiry—indicating that our fate has reached a critical juncture. Yet when the case was presented, higher authorities reversed the decision. Fortunately, the county’s Vice Minister of Culture intervened promptly and submitted a reply, though the local magistrate has since been reprimanded. Now the higher office insists on handling the matter personally; if they take it up, we shall surely suffer. We are short of silver—hasten and send more without delay!”  Madam Xue wept anew upon reading it. Baochai and Xue Ke comforted her, saying, “There is no time to waste.” With no alternative, Madam Xue ordered Xue Ke to attend to the matter. He quickly gathered his luggage, exchanged silver, and, accompanied by a helper from the pawnshop, set off in a frenzy that lasted until nearly the fourth watch before they finally rested. Accustomed as she was to the pampering of a rich family, Baochai—exhausted and anxious after a night of labor—fell ill the next day, unable even to eat her soup. Ying’er rushed to inform Madam Xue, who, upon finding Baochai flushed and burning as if aflame, wept inconsolably. Baoqin and Qiu Ling also burst into tears.
Just lie still and rest.”  Shortly afterward, Ziyuan helped Dai-yu to sleep, while the others in the Yihong Courtyard quietly resumed their duties. Meanwhile, outside, hushed voices continued. One small maid inquired, “Is Ziyuan still at home?” Snow-Quill went out and, upon seeing Xiren, whispered, “The young miss is here.” Xiren then softly asked, “How is she?” Snow-Quill, with a furrowed brow, recounted the events of the night. Xiren, alarmed by this news, said, “Good heavens—last night, I nearly fainted from fear! And now you say she must have a doctor called?”  As they spoke, Dai-yu began coughing again. Ziyuan rushed over with the phlegm-box. Dai-yu managed to open her eyes slightly and asked, “Who were you talking to?”  Ziyuan replied, “Xiren came to check on you.”  At that, Xiren drew near, and Dai-yu pleaded, “Please, don’t let Second Master know…”  Xiren’s voice trembled as she comforted her, “Rest, dear, let’s not worry about it now.”  Dai-yu’s eyes filled with tears as she lay back down, while Xiren stayed close to watch over her. Later, Tan-chun and Xiang-yun, having left Xiuxiang Hall, made their way toward Grandmother Jia’s residence. Tan-chun advised, “Sister, when you see Grandmother, be careful not to be too hasty this time.” Xiang-yun agreed with a nod, “I know—I almost forgot myself earlier!”  When they arrived, Grandmother Jia, already troubled by Dai-yu’s ailment, mentioned it softly, “These two ‘Jade’ girls seem to suffer so many misfortunes. When Lin-girl visits now, her health is delicate indeed. I fear for her heart.” None dared answer. Grandmother Jia then instructed Yiyang, “Tell them that tomorrow the doctor will come to examine Bao Yu and instruct him to visit Lin-girl’s room.” Yiyang agreed and went off to relay the message. Later that evening, the doctor arrived. After examining Bao Yu, he declared that his symptoms were simply due to improper diet and a touch of cold—a mild condition that would improve with some rest. Meanwhile, Madame Wang and Madame Feng sent someone to Xiuxiang Hall to announce, “The doctor is here.” Ziyuan hurried off to inform Dai-yu, who then had her bedding properly arranged by Snow-Quill and Yiyang. Soon after, Jia Lian accompanied the doctor inside and said, “This gentleman has long been a regular visitor; the young miss need not hide herself from him.” The old doctor asked, “Now, tell me, how is your condition?” Ziyuan carefully brought out one of Dai-yu’s hands so the doctor might take her pulse. After a long while, the doctor emerged and said, “All your channels are constricted—a result of prolonged stagnation.”  He explained, “That is why you often experience dizziness and restless dreams. Even during the day, if you hear something unrelated, it will unsettle you. It appears that your liver yin is deficient and your heart qi is waning; these are the root causes. You must soothe your liver and protect your lungs, nurture your heart and spleen. Though supplements may help, do not rush their use. I suggest we first use a remedy called ‘Hei Xiaoyao’ to disperse stagnation, followed by one called ‘Gui Fei Gu Jin’ to consolidate your lung’s metal. I do not claim to be perfect; I await your high counsel.”  After writing out a prescription along with a list of seven medicinal ingredients and an herbal adjuvant, Jia Lian reviewed it and inquired, “Does the formula account for blood stagnation? Is Bupleurum appropriate?”  The doctor laughed and explained, “Second Master, you only know Bupleurum as an uplifting herb for expelling excess—yet few know that when stir-fried with soft turtle blood, it prevents excessive rising while nourishing the liver yin and quelling pernicious fire. As the Neijing says, ‘When the channel is open, use open herbs; when it is blocked, use blocking herbs.’ This method is exactly what we are employing.”  Jia Lian nodded.
As the night deepened and fatigue set in—with most unable to stand the wine—the mood grew a bit languid. Yet Grandmother Jia’s high spirits were not yet dampened, so she continued to drink in good company. She then commanded that thick felt blankets be spread on the steps and that mooncakes, watermelons, fruits, and other refreshments be brought down. She also ordered the maidservants and wives to sit closely together to admire the moon. Grandmother Jia, looking up at the moon now high in the sky, remarked that its beauty was more enchanting than ever before, and she said, “Such a splendid moon calls for the sound of the flute.” She then ordered that a performance by a female musician be arranged. “Too much music can sometimes lose its refinement—let the flute alone be played from afar; that will suffice.”  No sooner had she spoken than, as the musician began to play, a servant of Mrs. Xing’s approached her mistress with a few words. Grandmother Jia inquired, “What is it?” Mrs. Xing replied, “Just now, when the eldest master went out, he tripped on a stone and twisted his leg.” Hearing this, Grandmother Jia immediately ordered two old women to go and examine him, and she also sent Mrs. Xing off to check on him. Mrs. Xing then excused herself and departed. Grandmother Jia added, “Then, let Zhen’s daughter-in-law leave at once so that I may go to sleep.” Lady You protested with a laugh, “I’m not going back today—I insist on keeping the old matriarch’s company throughout the night.” Grandmother Jia replied with a smile, “That won’t do. You two young couples must remain together; how can you delay me?” Blushing, Lady You laughed, “The old matriarch says we are so inadequate! Though we are young and have been married for only twenty-something years and are nearing forty, and our mourning clothes have not yet been worn for long, spending the night with you is proper.” Hearing this, Grandmother Jia laughed, “Indeed, you speak rightly. I have almost forgotten that the mourning period is not yet complete. Alas, your father has been gone for more than two years now! But I almost forgot—I must have a large cup poured in my honor. Since that is so, you need not send anyone; just stay with me. Have Rong’s daughter-in-law send the food over, and then you may return.” Lady You explained this to Jia Rong’s wife, who agreed and, after seeing Mrs. Xing off, accompanied the group to the main gate. Meanwhile, the maidservants who had been sent off earlier returned. While riding in her carriage, Lady You looked out at the two stone lions flanking the gate. There she saw four or five large vehicles parked outside and remarked to little Silver Butterfly, “Look—those who travel by carriage, and who knows how many by horse!” Then she entered the mansion and reached the hall, where Jia Rong’s wife had come out with her maidservants, all wearing ornate head coverings. Lady You laughed and said, “I have always wanted to secretly watch them gamble, but never had a chance; today, what luck—we can now stroll right by their windows.” The wives agreed and, taking lanterns to light the way, proceeded. One of them went ahead quietly to inform the hidden footmen not to startle anyone. Thus, Lady You and her retinue stealthily reached a window, where they could hear voices from inside—exchanging compliments and jokes, along with curses and complaints. It turned out that Jia Zhen, recently stricken with mourning and unable to enjoy himself, had grown unbearably bored and devised a way to entertain himself. Under the pretext of practicing archery during the day, he invited several young gentlemen from aristocratic families as well as many wealthy friends to a shooting contest. He declared, “Shooting recklessly is useless—it neither improves skill nor preserves form; we must fix a wager so that everyone has an incentive to do well.” Thus, beneath the Tianxiang Tower in the arrow range, a swan-shaped wooden target was set up, and it was agreed that every morning after breakfast, all would take turns shooting at the swan. Not keen on being in the spotlight himself, Jia Zhen appointed his younger cousin Jia Rong to organize the contest. These young men—typical of the roving, dashing gang of playboys—engaged in cockfighting, dog racing, and even bantered about pretty girls.
Though Baochan dared not fight back, he began to thrash about as if courting death – by day with knives and scissors, by night with ropes – causing endless commotion. Xue Pan, caught between loyalties he could not resolve, eventually stood helplessly by, thoroughly exasperated, and left the house in despair. Jin Gui, meanwhile, secretly explained to Baochan that that very night Xue Pan was to be “married” in Qiu Ling’s room – meaning that she was to be forced to accompany him in bed. At first Qiu Ling refused, but Jin Gui insisted that she must not be overly particular about comfort during the dark hours. She scolded, “Have you not seen our master? He hoards his maidservants so no one may approach you – what is your plan? I fear you intend to ruin me!” Worried that this might spoil Baochan’s reputation, Xue Pan quickly returned and admonished Qiu Ling, “If you do not obey, I will beat you!” With no alternative, Qiu Ling had to gather her bedding and lie down on the floor, reluctantly obeying. No sooner had she settled than she was repeatedly summoned for tea throughout the night, and her legs were struck several times so that she could not rest a moment. Xue Pan, having secured Baochan as if he were a treasure, ignored all else. In his bitterness, Jin Gui murmured, “Let him have his fun for a few days; when he grows distant, then I can arrange Xiangling as I wish. Then Baochan, originally mine, will be of no consequence.” Quietly enduring, she schemed to further control Qiu Ling. After about half a month, Qiu Ling suddenly feigned illness, complaining of unbearable heartache and immobility, with treatments proving ineffective. Everyone remarked that it was due to her suppressed anger. After two days, unexpectedly, someone discovered a paper effigy hidden among Jin Gui’s pillows – inscribed with her age and an eight-character phrase, with five needles pinned into her chest and between her ribs and limbs. Thus the household took it as news and reported it first to Aunt Xue. Aunt Xue grew frantic, and Xue Pan became even more disordered, threatening to interrogate everyone. Jin Gui said, “There is no need to wrong the innocent; it appears that Baochan’s ‘demon-repelling charm’ must be employed.” Xue Pan replied, “But she has not spent much time in your room lately; why cling to a good woman?” Jin Gui sneered, “Who else is there? Am I not the only one? Even if there were others, who would dare enter my room?” Xue Pan said, “Now that Qiu Ling follows you every day, she surely knows; ask her and you will find out.” Jin Gui laughed coldly, “Ask whom? Who will confess? In my view, they will all pretend not to know – so let it drop. Besides, even if I were punished to death, it matters little; I could always remarry someone better. Truly, if you complain, who will not blame me?” Tears streaming down, she continued, “Then why must you involve everyone? I fear I will be blamed if you persist.” Xue Pan’s anger mounted further, and he seized a door bolt, stormed off, and without further ado confronted Qiu Ling, accusing her bluntly. Qiu Ling cried out in protest. Aunt Xue rushed in and commanded, “Do not start beating her until you understand the whole truth! This maidservant has served for years—wasn’t there a time when she made a mistake? Would you really do something so heartless? Ask clearly first, then act!” Hearing this, Jin Gui feared that Xue Pan might soften and began to weep bitterly, “For half a month you have monopolized my Baochan, kept her from entering my room, and only allowed Qiu Ling to sleep with me. I wish to question Baochan, yet you continue protecting him. Now you act so defiantly as to beat her—if you kill me, then remarry as you please; why must you put on this farce?” Xue Pan’s anger grew even more. Aunt Xue, seeing how her daughter-in-law oppressed her son, cursed bitterly. In her fury she ordered, “Sell Xiangling immediately!” Miss Bao then laughed, “Our family only knows how to buy people, not sell them—madam, you are completely confused.

If word gets out, won’t it be a laughingstock? If my elder brother and sister-in-law despise her and leave her to me, I’m doomed!” Aunt Xue replied, “Better to dismiss her entirely than let her remain with us.” Miss Bao laughed, “Whether she stays with me or not matters nothing—cut her off as if she were sold.” Xiangling had already run up to Aunt Xue, pleading bitterly and crying, unwilling to leave; she wished instead to remain with the young lady. Aunt Xue, with no alternative, had to relent. Thereafter, Xiangling left with Miss Bao, effectively severing her ties with the past. Yet she could not help but feel sorrow under the moonlight, and by lamplight she quietly lamented. Although she had spent several years in Xue Pan’s household, her delicate condition – worsened by her inherited illness – meant she never bore children; now, further aggravated by anger and distress, her health declined, and she eventually developed a “dry blood” disorder, growing thinner and losing her appetite with no remedy proving effective. Meanwhile, Xue Pan and Jin Gui’s quarrels continued as before. (…The narrative here continues with further domestic strife, bitter exchanges, and chaotic interactions among the household members. Various conflicts over personal belongings, insults, and even physical altercations ensued—while the scheming of Jin Gui, the inciting of jealousy by Xue Pan, and the heartbreak of the maidservants all compounded the troubled atmosphere. In the midst of these turbulent events, discussions of marriage arrangements, matters of inheritance, and the comings and goings of various kin are recounted. Gossip spreads, alliances shift, and each individual’s fate becomes interwoven with the emotional turbulence of the household. Even as Bao Yu suffers from sorrow and illness, and as the family prepares for ancestral rites and visits to temples, the conflicts and intrigues continue unabated.
Fearing intruders, Miaoyu rose from her meditation and went out into the veranda. There, she saw shifting shadows across the sky and the pale glow of the moon like flowing water. Although the weather was not terribly cold, she stood alone at the balustrade for a long while. Suddenly, she heard two cats outside meowing and hissing at one another. At that moment, Miaoyu recalled Baoyu’s words earlier in the day, and her heart began to race, her ears burning with heat. She quickly composed herself and retreated to her inner room, returning to her meditation seat. Yet her mind would not settle; it raced like a stampede of horses, and she felt as if her body were no longer rooted in the hermitage. In her delirium, visions of many noble youths came to court her, while matchmakers jostled and pulled her onto a carriage; then, bandits appeared brandishing knives and clubs, forcing her to cry out for help. The sudden chaos woke the Taoist nun and other attendant nuns, who rushed in with torches to check on her. They found Miaoyu’s hands flung wide, frothing at the mouth. As they roused her, her eyes were wide open, her cheeks flushed bright red, and she shouted, “I am protected by the Buddha! How dare you ruffians threaten me?” The attendants, utterly confused, urged, “We are here—please calm down and wake!” Miaoyu insisted, “I must return home! If there is any honest soul, send me back immediately.” The nun replied, “This is your residence,” and called for other nuns to hastily pray before the Guanyin statue. They drew lots, and upon reading the lot, found that she had offended a malevolent spirit in the southwest corner. One said, “Indeed, in the southwest corner of the Grand View Garden no one resides—yet the sinister qi remains.” Meanwhile, the nuns scrambled about with water and soup. One of the nuns, who had accompanied Miaoyu from the south, devoted herself to serving her faithfully, seating herself around Miaoyu’s meditation mat. Miaoyu looked up and asked, “Who are you?” The nun replied, “It is I.” Miaoyu examined her closely and said, “Ah, it is you!” Overcome, she embraced the nun and wept, “You are like a mother to me—if you do not save me, I cannot live!” The nun called for help and gently massaged her, while the Taoist nun poured her some tea. Only at dawn did Miaoyu fall asleep. The nun then sent someone to fetch a physician. Some said her condition was due to spleen injury from overthinking, others attributed it to heat in the blood, or to an invasion of evil spirits, while still others believed it was simply an external cold; ultimately, no consensus was reached. Finally, a doctor arrived, asked, “Have you been meditating?” The Taoist nun answered, “Yes, she has meditated regularly.” The doctor inquired, “Did this ailment come on suddenly last night?” The nun confirmed, “Indeed.” The doctor explained, “This is the result of the demon within stirring up fire.” When asked if it was serious, he replied, “Fortunately, her meditation was short, and the demon’s influence was shallow—there is hope for recovery.” He prescribed medicine to subdue the inner fire, and after one dose, her condition slightly improved. Outside, rumors began to circulate among the wandering idlers: “At such an age, how can one endure this? Moreover, with her elegant yet refined nature, who knows in whose hands she will eventually fall?” After several days, though Miaoyu’s illness improved somewhat, her spirit remained unsettled, and she continued to be somewhat disoriented. One day, as Xi-chun sat in quiet contemplation, Caiping suddenly entered and said, “Miss, have you heard about what happened to Miaoyu, our master’s disciple?” Xi-chun asked, “What happened?” Caiping replied, “Yesterday I overheard Miss Xing and the eldest lady saying that after she played chess with you that day, that very night she suddenly fell ill, exclaiming that bandits were coming to rob her. To this day she has not recovered. Miss, isn’t this a strange affair?” Xi-chun was silent. She thought, “Though Miaoyu is pure and untainted, her worldly ties have not been completely severed.
I wish to question Baochan, yet you continue protecting him. Now you act so defiantly as to beat her—if you kill me, then remarry as you please; why must you put on this farce?” Xue Pan’s anger grew even more. Aunt Xue, seeing how her daughter-in-law oppressed her son, cursed bitterly. In her fury she ordered, “Sell Xiangling immediately!” Miss Bao then laughed, “Our family only knows how to buy people, not sell them—madam, you are completely confused. If word gets out, won’t it be a laughingstock? If my elder brother and sister-in-law despise her and leave her to me, I’m doomed!” Aunt Xue replied, “Better to dismiss her entirely than let her remain with us.” Miss Bao laughed, “Whether she stays with me or not is immaterial—cut her off as if she were sold.” Xiangling had already run up to Aunt Xue, pleading bitterly and crying, unwilling to leave; she wished instead to remain with the young lady. Aunt Xue, with no alternative, had to relent. Thereafter, Xiangling left with Miss Bao, effectively severing her ties with the past. Yet she could not help but feel sorrow under the moonlight, and by lamplight she quietly lamented.

Meanwhile, Jin Gui continued to quarrel with Xue Pan. On occasion, emboldened by wine, he confronted her twice. When he tried to strike with a stick, Jin Gui dodged and ordered him away. When he nearly drew a knife, she stretched out her neck defiantly. Unable to bring himself to hit her, Xue Pan raged for a while before giving up. Over time, this became habitual, and Jin Gui’s insults toward Baochan grew ever more severe. Baochan, who could not compare with Xiangling, was like dry tinder; having bonded with Xue Pan through shared feelings, he completely disregarded Jin Gui. Outraged by her continual mistreatment, Baochan refused to relent. At first there were verbal spats and shoving; later Jin Gui’s anger escalated to physical blows. Though Baochan dared not retaliate, he began to thrash about as if courting death – by day with knives and scissors, by night with ropes – causing endless commotion. Xue Pan, caught between loyalties he could not resolve, eventually stood helplessly by, thoroughly exasperated, and left the house in despair. Jin Gui, meanwhile, secretly explained to Baochan that that very night Xue Pan was to be “married” in Qiu Ling’s room – meaning that she was forced to accompany him in bed.

After about half a month, Qiu Ling suddenly feigned illness, complaining of unbearable heartache and immobility with treatments proving ineffective. Everyone remarked that it was due to her suppressed anger. After two days, unexpectedly, someone discovered a paper effigy hidden among Jin Gui’s pillows – inscribed with her age and an eight-character phrase, with five needles pinned into her chest and between her ribs and limbs. Thus the household took it as news and reported it first to Aunt Xue.
Meanwhile, Xiren and the others quietly absorbed every detail. Though some of the rumor reached their ears, they noted that Baochai had not yet arrived, and increasingly began to believe the truth. Hearing all this, Xiren’s heart, initially light with relief, turned troubled. She thought, “Truly, the higher-ups have eyes that see clearly—this arrangement suits our fate! If he agrees, I could be relieved of many burdens. But this man’s heart has always been set on Lin Guniang. Fortunately, he did not hear it, for if he did, who knows what chaos might ensue? If he were to behave as he did in his youthful folly—when, in the summer in the garden, he treated me as if I were Lin Guniang and confessed his secret heart, and then, when Zizhuan teased, he cried as if his life depended on it—if now we tell him that he is to marry Miss Bao, forsaking Lin Guniang... Only if he remains oblivious can it work. But if he understands, not only will it not restore his luck, it may even hasten his ruin! I must not speak further, or it will spell trouble for three people!” Resolute, Xiren planned that when Jia Zheng departed, she would have Qiu Wen watch over Baoyu and then quietly slip out to find Madam Wang. She then approached Madam Wang, and in hushed tones pleaded that they speak in the room behind Jia Mu’s quarters. Jia Mu, meanwhile, remained absorbed in planning the wedding rites, unconcerned about Baoyu’s state. Xiren and Madam Wang, once secluded in the inner room, fell to their knees and burst into tears. Not understanding at first, Madam Wang gently took Xiren’s hand and said, “What is this? Speak now—what grievance have you?” Xiren choked, “I shouldn’t speak, but I’m at my wit’s end!” “Speak slowly,” urged Madam Wang. Xiren confided, “The old lady and Madam have decided on a match for Miss Bao—it would be a fine matter. But I wonder, in your eyes, is it better for Baoyu to wed Miss Bao or Lin Guniang?” Madam Wang replied, “They grew up together, so perhaps Baoyu and Lin Guniang have a closer bond.” Xiren insisted, “It isn’t ‘closer’ enough.” She went on to recount, in detail, the various incidents involving Baoyu and Daiyu over the years—matters which, Madam Wang herself had witnessed, though Xiren had never dared speak of them. Taking Xiren’s words to heart, Madam Wang whispered, “It appears the rumors are gaining ground. And if you listen to what the old master said, look at his expression!” Xiren said, “Nowadays, whenever someone speaks to Baoyu he smiles; if no one speaks, he sleeps—so he hasn’t really heard a word of what’s been said.” Madam Wang sighed, “What are we to do about this?” Xiren replied, “I have spoken, but now it falls to you to tell the old lady and devise a foolproof plan.” Madam Wang then said, “Very well—do as you must. For now, let no one else mention this matter. As for the second mistress’s side, I fear they will not agree. If they do consent, we must proceed according to the old lady’s wishes.” She added, “The second mistress’s side is under my protection—you go, then.” Jia Zheng, after hearing all this, was at a loss. For his assignment left him uneasy, and though the household was abuzz with preparations for the wedding, the news of Baoyu’s condition remained a heavy burden. Soon, Baoyu met with Jia Zheng and was taken by Xiren back to his room. With Jia Zheng away, no one dared speak to him directly; thus, he drifted into a daze and fell into a fitful sleep, oblivious to all that had been said. Yet Xiren and the others quietly grasped every detail. Though some stray whispers had reached them, the absence of Baochai’s presence lent credence to the truth. That day, as they absorbed these developments, Xiren’s heart vacillated between joy and sorrow. She mused, “Truly, the higher-ups have seen clearly—our fate is in their hands!
When he returned to his bed, he saw a man and a woman sitting there. He rushed over to ask who they were, only to find that a rope had been looped around his neck. He immediately called for help. The others, upon hearing this, lit lamps and came running, only to find that they had both collapsed on the bed, foaming at the mouth. Fortunately, they were revived. At that time, he could not eat anything, so he sent for some small side dishes.” I explained to the old lady that since she was not in the room, I couldn’t intervene, so I told him, “The old lady isn’t available right now; when she returns, she will be informed.” And I sent him on his way. Just then, when I heard mention of the southern dishes, I remembered them—lest we forget.”  Sister Feng paused in astonishment and said, “The southern side dishes are still available—have someone send them over. As for the silver, wait until Brother Qin comes tomorrow to collect it.”  Then Xiao Hong entered and announced, “Just now Second Master sent word that he has urgent business outside the city tonight and cannot return—please notify everyone accordingly.”  Sister Feng replied, “That’s right.”  While they were talking, a little maid came panting from the back, running into the courtyard. Outside, Ping’er and several other maidservants were chattering nervously. Sister Feng asked, “What are you all saying?”  Ping’er replied, “One of the little maids, trembling with fear, said she heard voices like a clamor coming from three empty rooms in the back—like the sound of cats or mice or even someone venting anger. She got so frightened that she ran back.”  Sister Feng scolded, “Nonsense! I won’t have you spreading ghost stories. I never believe such superstitions—now get out of here!”  The little maid scurried away. Sister Feng then called Cai Ming to go over the daily miscellaneous accounts. It was already nearly the second watch of the night. After a brief rest and some idle chatter, everyone was told to retire. Sister Feng herself then went to sleep. Approaching the third watch, Sister Feng seemed unable to sleep. Feeling a sudden chill running down her spine, she awoke more and more agitated. She called Ping’er and Qiu Tong to keep her company. The two were puzzled by her mood. Originally, Qiu Tong had not been on good terms with Sister Feng, but after Jia Lian’s affair with You Er (the Second Sister) diminished his favor for Qiu Tong, and Sister Feng began to court him, Qiu Tong had grown quieter—though her heart remained more troubled than Ping’er’s. Seeing that Sister Feng was distraught, Qiu Tong brought some tea. Sister Feng sipped it and said, “Thank you, but go back to sleep; it is enough if Ping’er stays here.”  Qiu Tong, wishing to be of service, said, “If the old lady can’t sleep, perhaps the two of us should take turns keeping watch.” Sister Feng murmured a few words and then fell asleep. When Ping’er and Qiu Tong later saw that Sister Feng had indeed fallen asleep, they heard a distant crowing of a rooster. The two quickly dressed and arose to attend to Sister Feng’s grooming. Sister Feng, still in a daze from her nocturnal disturbances, insisted on getting up. As she sat pondering, a little maid from the courtyard called out, “Is Miss Ping’er in the room?” Ping’er answered in the affirmative. The little maid then lifted the curtain and entered—it was the one sent by Madam Wang to fetch Jia Lian, saying, “There is urgent official business outside. The Master has just left, and the Mistress has sent word to quickly summon Second Master.”  Sister Feng was startled. To be continued… Chapter 89: When the Deceased Remain but Their Possessions Live On—The Young Master Composes Verses for the Orphan, While the Family’s Strict Customs Lead Jia Zhen to Flog a Recalcitrant Servant  It happened that Sister Feng (Fengjie) was just rousing herself from sleep in a state of puzzlement when a little maid’s voice startled her. The maid hastily asked, “What is the official matter?” The little maid replied, “I don’t know exactly.
There she saw the old lady sitting on the divan where Baoyu usually reclined. Daiyu immediately said, “Please greet the old lady.” Stepping back, she then encountered the Second Wife of Prince Xing; after that, she met Li Wan, Tan Chun, Xi Chun, and Xing Xiuyan, exchanging pleasantries. Only Feng Jie was absent due to illness; Shi Xiangyun had returned to the capital with her uncle on a transfer; Xue Baoqin was staying with her elder sister; and the Li sisters, because of the tumult in the garden, had been sent out by Aunt Li to reside elsewhere. So, today, Daiyu saw only a few people. After a short while of laughter and conversation about the strangely blooming flower, Jia Mu said, “These flowers normally bloom in March. Though it is now November, owing to the delayed season—more like October in a mild ‘little spring’—with warm weather, the flowers can indeed bloom.”  Madam Wang added, “The old lady has seen many, so she’s not surprised.”  Lady Xing remarked, “I heard that these flowers had withered for an entire year. Why should they bloom now, out of season? There must be an underlying reason.”  Li Wan laughed, “The old lady and Madam are both saying the same thing. In my muddled thinking, it must be that Baoyu has some joyous event forthcoming, and this flower is the harbinger of good news.”  Though Tan Chun said nothing, inwardly she mused, “It must not be an auspicious sign. Generally, those who follow the natural order prosper, while those who rebel perish; even plants know their time—if they bloom out of season, it must be a portent of disaster.” But she dared not voice her thought. Only Daiyu, interpreting it as a sign of good fortune, felt her heart stirred and happily remarked, “In the Tian family there once stood a thorn bush; when the three brothers split the family, the bush withered. Later, moved by the feelings among them, they reunited, and the bush revived. This shows that even plants follow the fate of people. Now that Second Brother is diligently studying and Uncle is pleased, that very bush has bloomed.”  Jia Mu and Madam Wang were pleased by her analogy, saying, “Lin Miss’s comparison is quite appropriate and interesting.”  Just then, Jia She, Jia Zheng, Jia Huan, and Jia Lan all came in to see the flower. Jia She remarked, “In my opinion, we should cut it down—it must be the work of a flower demon.”  Jia Zheng countered, “If one sees a demon, it will defeat itself. There is no need to cut it down; just let it be.”  Hearing this, Jia Mu said, “Who is here to blather? If there is good news, then who cares about demons? If the news is favorable, enjoy it; if it is not, I alone will bear the responsibility. You are not allowed to babble!”  Jia Zheng, hearing this, dared not speak further and awkwardly left with Jia She and the others. The old lady, in high spirits, ordered that a message be sent to the kitchen: “Quickly prepare a feast so that everyone may enjoy the flower.” She then told Baoyu, Huan’er, and Lan’er, “Each of you must compose a four-line poem in celebration. Lin Miss’s illness has just abated—don’t trouble her. If you’re in high spirits, I will help refine your verses.” Turning to Li Wan, she said, “You all accompany me in drinking.” Li Wan agreed, smiling at Tan Chun, “It’s all your doing.” Tan Chun retorted, “If you hadn’t forced us to write poems, how would we have stirred things up?” Li Wan replied, “Wasn’t it you who established the Haitang Society? Now even the Haitang tree must join the society.” Everyone laughed at that. Soon the wine and dishes were set out, and as everyone drank, each tried to win the old lady’s favor, speaking high-spirited words. Baoyu then stepped forward, poured some wine, and promptly composed a four-line poem to recite for Jia Mu:    What’s the cause that Haitang withers so suddenly? Today its abundant blossoms serve as its base?
When he tried to strike with a stick, Jin Gui dodged and ordered him away. When he nearly drew a knife, she stretched out her neck defiantly. Unable to bring himself to hit her, Xue Pan raged for a while before giving up. Over time, this became habitual, and Jin Gui’s insults toward Baochan grew ever more severe. Baochan, who could not compare with Xiangling, was like dry tinder; having bonded with Xue Pan through shared feelings, he completely disregarded Jin Gui.

I fear you intend to ruin me!” Worried that this might spoil Baochan’s reputation, Xue Pan quickly returned and admonished Qiu Ling, “If you do not obey, I will beat you!” With no alternative, Qiu Ling had to gather her bedding and lie down on the floor, reluctantly obeying. No sooner had she settled than she was repeatedly summoned for tea throughout the night, and her legs were struck several times so that she could not rest a moment. Xue Pan, having secured Baochan as if he were a treasure, ignored all else. In his bitterness, Jin Gui murmured, “Let him have his fun for a few days; when he grows distant, then I can arrange Xiangling as I wish. Then Baochan, originally mine, will be of no consequence.” Quietly enduring, she schemed to further control Qiu Ling. After about half a month, Qiu Ling suddenly feigned illness, complaining of unbearable heartache and immobility with treatments proving ineffective. Everyone remarked that it was due to her suppressed anger. After two days, unexpectedly, someone discovered a paper effigy hidden among Jin Gui’s pillows – inscribed with her age and an eight-character phrase, with five needles pinned into her chest and between her ribs and limbs. Thus the household took it as news and reported it first to Aunt Xue. Aunt Xue grew frantic, and Xue Pan became even more disordered, threatening to interrogate everyone. Jin Gui said, “There is no need to wrong the innocent; it appears that Baochan’s ‘demon-repelling charm’ must be employed.” Xue Pan replied, “But she has not spent much time in your room lately; why cling to a good woman?” Jin Gui sneered, “Who else is there? Am I not the only one? Even if there were others, who would dare enter my room?” Xue Pan said, “Now that Qiu Ling follows you every day, she surely knows; ask her and you will find out.” Jin Gui laughed coldly, “Ask whom? Who will confess? In my view, they will all pretend not to know – so let it drop. Besides, even if I were punished to death, it matters little; I could always remarry someone better. Truly, if you complain, who will not blame me?” Tears streaming down, she continued, “Then why must you involve everyone? I fear I will be blamed if you persist.” Xue Pan’s anger mounted further, and he seized a door bolt, stormed off, and without further ado confronted Qiu Ling, accusing her bluntly. Qiu Ling cried out in protest. Aunt Xue rushed in and commanded, “Do not start beating her until you know the whole truth! This maidservant has served for years—was there not a time when she made a mistake? Would you really do something so heartless? Ask clearly first, then act!” Hearing this, Jin Gui feared that Xue Pan might soften and began to weep bitterly, “For half a month you have monopolized my Baochan, kept her from entering my room, and only allowed Qiu Ling to sleep with me.
In his bitterness, Jin Gui murmured, “Let him have his fun for a few days; once he grows distant, then I can arrange for Xiangling. Then Baochan, originally mine, will be useless.” Quietly enduring, she schemed to further manipulate Qiu Ling. After about half a month, Qiu Ling suddenly pretended to be ill, complaining of unbearable heartache and immobility with treatments proving ineffective. Everyone remarked that it was due to her suppressed anger. After two days, unexpectedly, someone discovered a paper effigy hidden among Jin Gui’s pillows – bearing her age and an inscription of eight characters, with five needles pinned into her heart area and the gaps between her ribs and limbs. Thus the household took this as news and reported it first to Aunt Xue. Aunt Xue, now frantic, and Xue Pan, even more disordered, threatened to interrogate everyone. Jin Gui said, “There is no need to wrong innocent people. It appears that Baochan’s ‘demon-repelling charm’ must be used.” Xue Pan replied, “But she has not spent much time in your room lately; why cling to a good woman?” Jin Gui sneered, “Who else is there? Am I not the only one? Even if there were others, who would dare enter my room?” Xue Pan said, “Now that Qiu Ling follows you every day, she surely knows; question her and you will find out.” Jin Gui laughed coldly, “Question whom? Who will confess? In my view, they will all feign ignorance—so let it drop. Besides, even if I were to be punished to death, it matters little; I could always remarry someone better. Truly, if you complain, who will not blame me?” Bursting into tears, she continued, “Then why must you drag everyone into this? I fear I will be blamed if you persist.” Xue Pan’s anger mounted, and he snatched up a door bolt, stormed off, and without further ado confronted Qiu Ling, accusing her directly. Qiu Ling cried out in protest. Aunt Xue rushed in and commanded, “Do not start beating before you understand the whole story! This maidservant has served for years—was it not that she was careless once? Would you really do something so heartless? Ask clearly first, then act!” Hearing his mother’s words, Jin Gui feared Xue Pan might soften, and she began to cry bitterly, “For half a month you have monopolized my Baochan, kept her from entering my room, and only allowed Qiu Ling to sleep with me. I wish to question Baochan, yet you continue protecting him. Now you act so defiantly as to beat her—if you kill me, then go ahead and remarry someone better; why must you put on this show?” Xue Pan’s anger grew even more. Aunt Xue, seeing how his daughter-in-law was oppressing her son, cursed bitterly. In her fury she ordered, “Sell Xiangling immediately!” Miss Bao then laughed, “Our family only knows how to buy, not sell—madam, you are all confused. If word gets out, won’t it be a laughingstock? If my elder brother and sister-in-law despise her and leave her to me, I’m doomed!” Aunt Xue replied, “Better to dismiss her entirely than let her remain with us.” Miss Bao laughed, “Whether she stays with me or not makes no difference—cut her off as if she were sold.” Xiangling had already run up to Aunt Xue, pleading bitterly and crying, unwilling to leave; she wished instead to remain with the young lady. Aunt Xue, with no alternative, had to relent. Thereafter, Xiangling indeed left with Miss Bao, effectively severing her previous ties. Yet she could not help but feel sorrow under the moonlight, and by lamplight she lamented quietly. Although she had spent several years in Xue Pan’s household, her delicate condition – compounded by her inherent illness – meant she never bore children; now, further agitated by anger and emotional strain, her health declined, and she eventually developed a “dry blood” disorder, growing thinner and losing her appetite, with no remedy proving effective. At that time, Jin Gui repeatedly quarreled with Xue Pan. On occasion, bolstered by wine, Xue Pan would even confront her twice. When he attempted to strike with a stick, Jin Gui evaded and ordered him away. When he nearly drew a knife to kill, she stretched out her neck defiantly.
Then, early the next morning, there was a clamor inside saying that the mistress was gravely ill and that messengers were sent to offer their respects. The household was thrown into panic. Before anyone had time to react, word arrived that Consort Zhou had passed away. Can you imagine? Rumors from without combined with suspicion at home—it is almost too strange to believe!” Baochai remarked, “Not only are the rumors outside mixed up, but within the household when they heard the word ‘mistress,’ everyone scrambled; only afterward did they come to understand. Just the other day, some of the maids said they had long known it wasn’t our elder sister. I asked them, ‘How can you be so sure?’ They replied, ‘A few years ago in January, a fortune-teller from another province came and made a very accurate prediction. The old lady had our younger sisters’ birth charts placed alongside Princess Yuan’s, and when he calculated, he said, ‘The girl born on the first day of the first lunar month—if the birth time is mistaken, then though she may be a noble, she cannot thrive in this household.’ Regardless of whether he was right, our master insisted on following his calculation. The fortune-teller then said, ‘In the year of Jia-Shen and on a Bing-Yin day, there are the elements of “Hurting Officer” and “Defeated Wealth.” But in the character for “Shen” there are also “Proper Officer” and “Salary Horse” symbols—this indicates a household that cannot keep her, and no good is to be expected. The day is Yi-Mao, in early spring when wood is flourishing. Though it shows the sign of “Peer,” it is said that the more one is “peer,” the worse it is—like fine timber that, if overworked, will never become a great material.’ Then he rejoiced at the appearance of Xin-Jin as the favorable element, and praised the unique prominence of “Proper Officer” and “Salary Horse” in the Si hour: this is known as the ‘Flying Luck Horse Pattern.’ He also mentioned that when one’s day is graced by ‘Exclusive Luck,’ one is extremely esteemed. ‘The Two Virtues of the Heavenly Moon’ presiding over one’s destiny ensure one receives the favor of the imperial harem. This young lady, if her birth time is correct, is destined to become a mistress of high standing. Isn’t that an accurate prediction? We still recall the saying, ‘Alas, glory is short-lived; one only fears that when the year of Yin meets the month of Mao, it will be like endless rivals, a constant struggle—as with fine timber, if it is too delicately carved, it loses its substance.’ They completely forgot all these details and only busied themselves with trivial matters. I then recalled and asked, ‘Tell our eldest lady, isn’t this year the year of Yin and the month of Mao?’” Before Baochai could finish recounting these words, Xue Ke hastily interrupted, “Let’s not concern ourselves with other people’s affairs. Since we have this accurate fortune-teller, I wonder what ill-star that has befallen our brother this year to cause such misfortune? Quickly, cast our brother’s birth chart—I will have it calculated to see if any inauspicious influences are at work.” Baochai replied, “He is from another province; I’m not sure if he is still in the capital this year.” With that, she arranged for Madam Xue to proceed to the Jia mansion. Once there, only Li Wan, Tan-chun, and a few others were at home. They asked, “How is our eldest uncle’s matter coming along?” Madam Xue explained, “We are awaiting further orders from our superiors; it seems that a death sentence is unlikely.” This news finally put everyone at ease. Tan-chun then said, “Last night the mistress remarked, ‘Last time, when there was trouble at home, we relied entirely on the Concubine to see things through; now that we have troubles of our own, it is equally hard to manage.’ It seems her mind is troubled.” Madam Xue replied, “I too am deeply grieved at home. But since your eldest brother has suffered this misfortune, and your two other brothers are off handling official matters, what use is your elder sister left alone?
In my opinion, dear sister, with your delicate health, it’s better not to trouble yourself with it.” Daiyu smiled softly. Baoyu pointed to the qin hanging on the wall and said, “Is this qin so short?” Daiyu laughed, “It is not short; when I was a child learning to play, the other qins were too large to handle, so this one was specially made for me. Though it is not the withered phoenix-tail of a Fuyong qin, its matching of the crane’s and phoenix’s features is just right—the dragons in its inlays and the subtle patterns evoke a clear, transcendent tone.” Baoyu then asked, “Sister, have you written any poetry these past few days?” Daiyu replied, “Since our society was formed, I have not composed much.” Baoyu laughed, “Don’t hide it from me. I recall hearing you recite a line like ‘How can pure heart compare to the moon in heaven?’—you set it into the qin’s melody, and it rang so clearly. What other verses have you composed?” Daiyu asked, “How did you hear that?” Baoyu said, “I heard it the other day coming from Liao Feng Pavilion, but I was afraid to disturb your pure melody, so I listened quietly for a while and then left. I was about to ask: at first the verse is in a level tone, but toward the end it shifts to a slanted tone—what does that mean?” Daiyu replied, “It is simply the natural expression of the human heart—the music flows as it must, with no fixed form.” Baoyu said, “I see. Alas, I do not have the refined taste to appreciate it; I only listened for a while in vain.” Daiyu sighed, “How few kindred spirits there have ever been in all ages!” Baoyu, realizing he had spoken too boldly and fearing he might chill Daiyu’s delicate heart further, fell silent. They sat together in quiet contemplation. Though Baoyu felt many things within, he found nothing more to say. Recalling his earlier words, which had spilled out impulsively, Daiyu felt they were too blunt. “If you meet Third Sister, please send her my regards,” she said. Baoyu agreed and departed. After escorting Daiyu to the door, he returned alone, sitting gloomily and thinking, “Lately, Baoyu’s words are so ambiguous—half-hearted, at times cold, at times warm—I do not know what he means.” Lost in thought, he barely noticed when Zijuan approached and asked, “Miss, have you finished writing? Shall I put away your brush and ink?” Daiyu replied, “I have finished; just pack them up.” Then, she went into her inner room and sat on her bed, leaning slightly as she pondered deeply. Zijuan returned and gently asked, “Miss, would you like a cup of tea?” Daiyu answered, “No, I’m not hungry—I’m just feeling a bit off. You all go on.” Zijuan left, and soon Snow Goose was found sitting quietly, lost in thought. Zijuan approached and asked, “Are you troubled too?” Snow Goose, startled out of his reverie, said, “Don’t shout—listen, today I heard something remarkable. Let me tell you, but don’t speak of it aloud.” He then cupped his hand around his mouth as if to keep a secret. Gathering courage, he beckoned Zijuan outside to the doorway, and in a hushed tone he said, “Sister, did you hear? They say that Baoyu has now been betrothed.” Zijuan gasped, “Where did you hear such a thing? It must not be true, must it?” Snow Goose insisted, “It’s as true as can be! Everyone else seems to know, only we hadn’t heard it.” Zijuan asked, “Where did you hear it?” Snow Goose replied, “I overheard the clerk talking—it was said that a certain governor’s family, with ample wealth and renowned talents, is involved.” Just then, they heard a cough from within; it seemed Daiyu was stirring. Fearing she might overhear, Zijuan tugged Snow Goose’s arm and peered discreetly inside.
It wasn’t during conversation when no one was around—it was later, when someone came to deliver goods at night. Grandmother’s ‘Silly Big Sister’s’ mother happened to be delivering freshly pressed garments, and while she was sitting in the lower room she saw a large chest of items and naturally inquired about them. The maids must have let it slip, and then the rumor spread.”  Accordingly, Ping’er summoned several little maids and asked, “Who told Silly Big Sister’s mother that day?”  The little maids, alarmed, knelt and swore solemnly, “None of us dared say more than a word! Whenever anyone asks, we all reply we know nothing—how could we dare speak?”  Feng Xifeng then explained in detail, “They wouldn’t dare say another word and risk blame. Let’s set this matter aside for now and focus on sending the Mistress away—it is most urgent. Better that we have fewer matters to worry about than cause further embarrassment.” Then she ordered, “Ping’er, take my gold ornaments and pledge them for two hundred taels of silver to settle this matter.”  Jia Lian remarked, “Might as well pledge an extra two hundred—we must show our resolve.”  Feng Xifeng replied, “There’s no need—I have no use for it. I’m not even sure which item is to be redeemed.”  Ping’er took the order and instructed Wang’er’s wife to handle it. Soon enough the silver was procured, and Jia Lian personally delivered it—matter resolved, for now. At that moment, Feng Xifeng and Ping’er discussed those suspected of spreading rumors. “Could it be that even Yuanyang is involved?” they murmured. Suddenly, someone announced, “The Mistress has arrived!”  Feng Xifeng was startled and, uncertain of what was happening, quickly went out with Ping’er to greet her. Meanwhile, Wang Furen’s expression grew even sterner; she entered accompanied by a single maid and, without a word, went into the inner chambers. Feng Xifeng quickly offered her tea and, forcing a smile, asked, “Madam, are you well today? Have you come for a stroll?”  Wang Furen curtly commanded, “Ping’er, go out!”  Startled, Ping’er immediately replied and led several young maids outside, standing by the door as it was securely closed. Then she herself sat on the steps, ensuring that no one could re-enter. Observing all this, Feng Xifeng grew anxious and asked, “Madam, what is the matter?”  Wang Furen, tears in her eyes, retrieved a perfumed sachet from her sleeve and threw it out, exclaiming, “Look here!”  Feng Xifeng quickly picked it up—it was a richly embroidered, multi‑colored “Spring Joy” sachet. Shocked, she asked, “Madam, where did you get this?”  Wang Furen, trembling and weeping, replied, “Where did I get it? I was sitting by the well—and I thought you were as attentive as I am! But it appears that in broad daylight this very item was found by one of Grandmother’s maids on a rock in the garden. Before long it would have been delivered to Grandmother. Tell me, how did it come to be here?”  Feng Xifeng, now even more agitated, asked, “Madam, how can you be sure it is mine?”  Wang Furen, still crying and lamenting, said, “How can I tell? Which other woman in our household would dare possess such an item? It is said that if a young lady is seen with it, even the servants would notice. If any maid were to find it and spread the word, our reputation would be ruined!”  Deeply embarrassed, Feng Xifeng knelt at the steps and, through tears, confessed, “Madam, I never meant for this to happen. That very sachet was a replica made outside—the tassels and all were bought on the market. Though I am young and do not consider myself haughty, I would never display such an item openly. Even if I did possess one, I would keep it hidden away in private; I could never wear it in public. Besides, if it were to appear in our garden where all our sisters mingle, not only would they see it, but so would the servants—and our reputation would be at risk.”  Wang Furen’s eyes filled with tears.
Jia Zheng read it and was intrigued, noticing that the verses carried a hint of discontent with reading, and thus said disapprovingly, “It shows that you two siblings: your words and sentiments belong to a degenerate school. In ancient times there were ‘two difficulties’ – you two might be called ‘the two difficulties.’ Only, it is not the character for ‘difficulty’ but rather ‘difficult to instruct’ that would be more appropriate. Brother, you openly claim to be like Wen Feiqing, yet now you and your brother are like reincarnated Cao Tang.” This remark made everyone laugh. Jia She said, “Bring me the poem so I can see.” He then praised it repeatedly, saying, “This poem, as I see it, has real backbone. I believe that for families like ours, one need not study under the flicker of fireflies; merely reading a few books so as to understand things a little, one would still have a chance at an official post. Why waste so much effort and turn out to be a bookworm? That is why I love this poem – it retains the spirit of our noble household.” Then he ordered for many of his playthings to be brought out as rewards for him, and patted Jia Huan’s head, laughing, “From now on, do it this way and your hereditary prospects are assured.” Hearing this, Jia Zheng quickly cautioned, “But he’s just rambling – that doesn’t count for future matters, does it?” With that, he poured another cup of wine and resumed the game. Grandmother Jia then said, “You all go on. Naturally, there are also officials waiting outside, so do not take them lightly. Moreover, there are more than two of you; disperse a bit, and let the young ladies enjoy themselves a little longer, so that they may rest.” Hearing this, Jia Zheng and the others ceased the game and rose, and after everyone drank a communal cup of wine, they set out with their children and nephews. Chapter 76: In Tubi Hall the Flute Is Played in Contemplation of Its Chilling Elegance; In the Concave Jing Pavilion, a Poem Is Composed in Sorrowful Loneliness  After Jia She, Jia Zheng, and Jia Zhen’s party had dispersed (details omitted), Grandmother Jia now ordered that the folding screens be taken down so that the two seating areas might be merged into one. The various wives and maidservants busied themselves wiping the tables, arranging fruits, and re-setting the cups and utensils. Once everyone had changed into fresh clothes, washed up, and enjoyed a cup of tea, they all sat down again in a close circle. Grandmother Jia, surveying the assembled company, noticed that Miss Bao’s sisters were missing from the gathering. Knowing that they had gone to complete the “Round Moon” ritual—and that Miss Li and Miss Feng were both unwell—she felt the atmosphere was somewhat subdued. Smiling, she remarked, “In past years when your father wasn’t at home, we would always invite our secondary wives to join us for the moon-viewing feast, and it was always so lively. Suddenly recalling your father’s presence now makes me think that husbands, wives, and children cannot all be together at once. And this year, though your father is here, it would not be proper to invite his wife and children to chatter and laugh together; besides, they have even increased in number this year, and it would be difficult to send them all here. Yet if we have only Miss Feng ill, one person’s banter is not worth the company of ten. Truly, it is impossible for worldly affairs always to be perfect!” With that, she sighed deeply and, as if in command, fetched a large cup to pour in some warm wine. Madame Wang laughed, “Today, with both father and children gathered, our reunion is more delightful than in previous years. In the past, even though there were many wives, it could not compare with the complete family we have now.” Grandmother Jia replied with a smile, “Exactly for that reason I am so pleased—bring me a large cup of wine. You all must also use large cups.” Mrs. Xing and the others had no choice but to exchange their small cups for larger ones. As the night deepened and fatigue set in—with most unable to stand the wine—the mood grew a bit languid. Yet Grandmother Jia’s high spirits were not yet dampened, so she continued to drink in good company.
Xue Pan, having secured Baochan as if it were a treasure, ignored all else. In his bitterness, Jin Gui murmured, “Let him have his fun for a few days; once he grows distant, then I can arrange for Xiangling. Then Baochan, originally mine, will be useless.” Quietly enduring, she schemed to further manipulate Qiu Ling. After about half a month, Qiu Ling suddenly pretended to be ill, complaining of unbearable heartache and immobility with treatments proving ineffective. Everyone remarked that it was due to her suppressed anger. After two days, unexpectedly, someone discovered a paper effigy hidden among Jin Gui’s pillows – bearing her age and an inscription of eight characters, with five needles pinned into her heart area and the gaps between her ribs and limbs. Thus the household took this as news and reported it first to Aunt Xue. Aunt Xue, now frantic, and Xue Pan, even more disordered, threatened to interrogate everyone. Jin Gui said, “There is no need to wrong innocent people. It appears that Baochan’s ‘demon-repelling charm’ must be used.” Xue Pan replied, “But she has not spent much time in your room lately; why cling to a good woman?” Jin Gui sneered, “Who else is there? Am I not the only one? Even if there were others, who would dare enter my room?” Xue Pan said, “Now that Qiu Ling follows you every day, she surely knows; question her and you will find out.” Jin Gui laughed coldly, “Question whom? Who will confess? In my view, they will all feign ignorance—so let it drop. Besides, even if I were to be punished to death, it matters little; I could always remarry someone better. Truly, if you complain, who will not blame me?” Bursting into tears, she continued, “Then why must you drag everyone into this? I fear I will be blamed if you persist.” Xue Pan’s anger mounted, and he snatched up a door bolt, stormed off, and without further ado confronted Qiu Ling, accusing her directly. Qiu Ling cried out in protest. Aunt Xue rushed in and commanded, “Do not start beating before you understand the whole story! This maidservant has served for years—was it not that she was careless once? Would you really do something so heartless? Ask clearly first, then act!” Hearing his mother’s words, Jin Gui feared Xue Pan might soften, and she began to cry bitterly, “For half a month you have monopolized my Baochan, kept her from entering my room, and only allowed Qiu Ling to sleep with me. I wish to question Baochan, yet you continue protecting him. Now you act so defiantly as to beat her—if you kill me, then go ahead and remarry someone better; why must you put on this show?” Xue Pan’s anger grew even more. Aunt Xue, seeing how his daughter-in-law was oppressing her son, cursed bitterly. In her fury she ordered, “Sell Xiangling immediately!” Miss Bao then laughed, “Our family only knows how to buy, not sell—madam, you are all confused. If word gets out, won’t it be a laughingstock? If my elder brother and sister-in-law despise her and leave her to me, I’m doomed!” Aunt Xue replied, “Better to dismiss her entirely than let her remain with us.” Miss Bao laughed, “Whether she stays with me or not makes no difference—cut her off as if she were sold.” Xiangling had already run up to Aunt Xue, pleading bitterly and crying, unwilling to leave; she wished instead to remain with the young lady. Aunt Xue, with no alternative, had to relent. Thereafter, Xiangling indeed left with Miss Bao, effectively severing her previous ties. Yet she could not help but feel sorrow under the moonlight, and by lamplight she lamented quietly. Although she had spent several years in Xue Pan’s household, her delicate condition – compounded by her inherent illness – meant she never bore children; now, further agitated by anger and emotional strain, her health declined, and she eventually developed a “dry blood” disorder, growing thinner and losing her appetite, with no remedy proving effective. At that time, Jin Gui repeatedly quarreled with Xue Pan. On occasion, bolstered by wine, Xue Pan would even confront her twice. When he attempted to strike with a stick, Jin Gui evaded and ordered him away.
Even if there were others, who would dare enter my room?” Xue Pan said, “Now that Qiu Ling follows you daily, she surely knows; question her and you will know.” Jin Gui laughed coldly, “Question whom? Who will confess? In my opinion, everyone will pretend not to know – so just drop it. In any case, even if I were to be punished to death, I wouldn’t mind; I could always remarry someone better. To be honest, wouldn’t you rather have three or more to blame me?” While speaking, she burst into tears. Xue Pan, further incensed by her words, snatched up a door bolt, stormed off, and, without a word, went straight to Qiu Ling and began beating her, accusing her without mercy. Qiu Ling protested her innocence. Aunt Xue rushed in and commanded, “Do not start beating without knowing the full story! This maidservant has served for years—was there not a time when she was careless? Would you really do such a heartless thing? Ask first before you act!” Jin Gui, hearing her mother’s reproach, feared that Xue Pan might soften his resolve, and began to bawl bitterly, “For half a month now you have monopolized my Baochan, kept her from entering my room, and only allowed Qiu Ling to sleep with me. I want to interrogate Baochan, yet you continue protecting him. Now you are so defiant as to beat her—if you kill me, then you may remarry a better one; why must you put on this farce?” Xue Pan’s anger grew ever more intense. Aunt Xue, observing how her daughter-in-law was oppressing her son, cursed bitterly. In her fury she ordered, “Sell Xiangling immediately!” Miss Bao then laughed, “Our family only knows how to buy people, not sell them – madam, you are in a state of confusion. If word gets out, won’t it be a laughingstock? If my elder brother and sister-in-law despise her and leave her to me, then I am doomed!” Aunt Xue replied, “Better to dismiss her completely than leave her with us.” Miss Bao laughed, “Whether she stays with me or not, it matters not—cut her off as if she were sold.” Xiangling had already run up to Aunt Xue, crying bitterly and pleading not to be dismissed; she wished instead to remain with the young lady. Aunt Xue, with no alternative, had to relent. After that, Xiangling indeed left with Miss Bao, effectively severing the old ties. Yet she could not help but feel sorrow under the moonlight, and by lamplight she lamented softly. Though she had spent several years in Xue Pan’s household, her delicate constitution – marred by her inherited illness – meant she never conceived; now, aggravated by anger and emotional strain, her health deteriorated further, and she gradually developed a “dry blood” syndrome, growing thinner and losing her appetite, with no effective remedy. Meanwhile, Jin Gui’s quarrels with Xue Pan grew more frequent. On some occasions, bolstered by wine, Xue Pan even confronted her twice. When he attempted to strike with a stick, Jin Gui dodged and ordered him away. When he nearly drew a knife to kill, she stretched out her neck in defiance. Xue Pan, unable to bring himself to hit her, raged for a while before giving up. Over time, this became habitual, and it even led Jin Gui to increasingly insult Baochan. Baochan, who could not compare with Xiangling, was like dry tinder; having bonded with Xue Pan over shared feelings, he completely disregarded Jin Gui. Outraged by Jin Gui’s continual mistreatment, Baochan refused to back down. At first there were quarrels and shoving; later Jin Gui’s anger escalated to insults, and then even to physical blows. Though Baochan dared not fight back, he began to roll and flail about as if seeking death, both by day with knives and scissors, and by night with ropes – causing endless havoc. Xue Pan, caught between conflicting loyalties, stood helplessly by, thoroughly exasperated, and eventually left the house in despair. Jin Gui, meanwhile, secretly explained to Baochan that that very night Xue Pan was to “marry” in Qiu Ling’s room – that is, she was to be made to accompany Jin Gui in bed. At first Qiu Ling refused, but Jin Gui insisted, claiming that she was being too fastidious and that comfort was secondary to convenience in the dark of night.
If they ask why it was smashed, what explanation will you give? They are also dead men walking. And if they decide to get into the nitty-gritty of it, what then?”  Baoyu said, “No, let’s say that I lost it when I went out.”  Everyone thought, “That could pass muster—but Baoyu hasn’t been away studying or anywhere else these past two days.”  Baoyu insisted, “Well, wasn’t it just the other day that I went to listen to an opera at Lord Lin’s mansion in Lin’an? Let’s say it was lost that day.”  Tan Chun said, “That doesn’t hold up either. If it was lost the other day, why didn’t you return immediately to search for it?”  While everyone was feverishly concocting excuses to cover up the truth, suddenly Zhao Yiniang burst in, crying and shouting, “You’ve lost something and haven’t searched for it yourselves! How can you then secretly interrogate Huan’er! I have brought Huan’er here—hand him over to us, and we’ll flog him as harshly as we please!” Shoving Huan’er aside, she said, “You’re a thief—confess quickly!” Huan’er, incensed, began to cry and shout. Just then, Li Zhi was about to mediate, when a maid said, “Madam has arrived.”  Xiren and the others, having nowhere to hide, rushed out to greet her. Zhao Yiniang, temporarily silenced by fear, followed. Seeing that everyone was in a state of panic, Madam Wang, convinced by the earlier reports, said, “Has that jade really gone missing?”  No one dared speak. Madam Wang then went into a room, sat down, and ordered Xiren—who, in her haste, knelt down tearfully—to explain. Madam Wang said, “Get up and quickly have everyone search carefully; in a rush, things can get out of hand.” Xiren choked on her tears, unable to speak properly. Baoyu, fearing that Xiren might reveal the truth, said, “Madam, this matter is not Xiren’s fault. I lost it on the way after listening to the opera at Lord Lin’s mansion the other day.”  Madam Wang asked, “Then why didn’t you search for it that day?”  Baoyu replied, “I was afraid that if they knew, they’d trouble me. I had Bèimì and others search outside.”  Madam Wang retorted, “Nonsense! After changing clothes, wasn’t it Xiren and her group who attended to you? When a young man returns from outside with a shortened handkerchief and purse, you expect an explanation, let alone when this jade goes missing. Don’t you ask?”  Baoyu was at a loss for words. Zhao Yiniang, seizing the opportunity, said smugly, “The loss outside is also Huan’er’s fault.”  Before she could finish, Madam Wang scolded, “Don’t talk about that here. You’d better leave those trivial matters alone!” Zhao Yiniang fell silent. Eventually, Li Zhi and Tan Chun confessed everything to Madam Wang. Madam Wang, moved to tears, decided to call Jia Mu back and to consult with Lady Xing about these people who had come. Meanwhile, even Feng Jie, though ill, had heard that Baoyu’s jade was lost. Knowing that Madam Wang was on her way, and that she could no longer hide, Feng Jie, with a timid air, took Feng’er and came into the garden. Just as Madam Wang was rising to leave, Feng Jie timidly said, “Please greet Madam.” Baoyu and the others went over to inquire after Feng Jie’s well-being. Madam Wang then said, “You’ve heard it too, haven’t you? Isn’t this an extraordinary matter? First, it seemed you couldn’t see it, and now it’s lost—if it cannot be found. Think about it: from the time you summoned the maids from the old lady’s side to those of you in Ping’er’s group, whose hands are not trembling and whose hearts are not scheming?
(The details need not be recounted further.)  Meanwhile, Xiangling, since the day she had boldly cornered Bao Yu, began to fear his advances and resolved henceforth to avoid him. Consequently, she rarely entered the Grand View Garden, and each day she was in a hurry. Xue Pan, having recently married, found that with his protective talisman the burdens on him were somewhat eased, and his life became comparatively quieter; moreover, he recognized that his new wife was a talented and refined beauty, naturally dignified and graceful. Her anticipation for the day when she would officially become his wife was ten times greater than Xue Pan’s own eagerness. At long last, on the appointed day, he became exceedingly attentive and careful in his service. It turned out that the Xia family’s young miss, now seventeen, was both attractive and had learned a few characters. In matters of inner sentiment and temperament, she seemed to follow in the footsteps of Xiangfeng. However, having lost her father at an early age and being the sole beloved daughter under a doting and overindulgent mother, she had unfortunately developed a rakish nature, regarding herself as a goddess while regarding others as naught. At home she would quarrel with the maidservants, curse and be struck. Later, after leaving the house, she was expected to manage the household herself—no longer the demure girl she once was. Upon seeing that Xue Pan’s aura was gradually diminishing, she began to assert herself. At first, she merely dominated Xue Pan, but later, by fawning and flirting, she even managed to win over Madame Wang; eventually, even Miss Bao would take note. Miss Bao, having long observed her scheming nature, often skillfully countered her words with subtle retorts. Knowing she could not be defied, Jin Gui (as she was called) resolved to seek an opportunity to humble her—but found no occasion to do so, and was forced to comply. One day, with nothing pressing to do, Jin Gui chatted casually with Xiangling and inquired about Xiangling’s family background. When Xiangling replied “I have forgotten,” Jin Gui became displeased and claimed she was deliberately deceiving him. “Who gave you the name ‘Xiangling’?” he demanded. Xiangling replied, “It was given by the girl herself.” Jin Gui scoffed, “Everyone says the girl is cultured, yet her name is not refined at all.” Xiangling quickly laughed, “If madam were to say that my name is unrefined, then she must not have understood my taste. In fact, her learning was even praised by our great-uncle in days past.” (What exactly Xiangling said next will be revealed in the next installment.) Chapter 80: When Beautiful Xiangling Must Suffer the Whip of a Greedy Husband, and When a Daoist’s Nonsensical Rants Incite a Jealous Wife  After the learned discussion had ended, Jin Gui (Golden Laurel) listened and, twisting her neck, pursed her lips, and snorted through her nostrils, coldly laughing: “Xiang – as in the blooming of water caltrops – who ever remarked that fragrance comes from them? If water caltrops were truly fragrant, then what use would there be for ordinary fragrant flowers? They are utterly out of place!”  Xiangling replied, “It isn’t only that water caltrops emit a delicate scent; even lotus leaves and seedpods possess a similar subtle fragrance. But they are not meant to be compared with the aroma of flowers. When one pays close attention – whether in the quiet of day or in the stillness of midnight – that gentle fragrance is even more pleasing than that of any flower. Even water caltrops, chicken heads, reed leaves, and rush roots, when caressed by the wind and dew, exude a refreshing scent that uplifts one’s spirit.”  Jin Gui retorted, “According to you, then, what of the fragrance of orchids and osmanthus? Are they not pleasing?”  At the height of the conversation, one of Jin Gui’s maidservants – named Baochan – suddenly pointed at Xiangling’s face and exclaimed, “You’ll be in deep trouble! How dare you utter the name of the girl?”  Startled, Xiangling immediately realized her mistake. Blushing, she hastily smiled and said, “I merely let my tongue run away with me; please, madam, do not hold it against me.”  Jin Gui laughed and said, “That is nothing—but you must be extra cautious.
After another couple of remarks—one in an angry tone proclaiming, “What man in the world is so unfortunately made?”—Xue Ke, recognizing that the voices belonged partly to Baocan and partly perhaps to Jin Gui, realized their true intent. He turned the matter over in his mind until after the fifth watch he finally managed to sleep. At daybreak, someone knocked at the door. Xue Ke hurriedly asked, “Who is it?” but no answer came. Reluctantly, he got up and opened the door to find Baocan standing there. Baocan, with his hair tousled and his arms wrapped around himself, was dressed in a finely tailored, tight-fitting jacket with delicate gold-trimmed pipa-collar, secured by a half-new, pine-green sweatband. He wore no skirt underneath, exposing stone-pomegranate red embroidered breeches, and his feet were clad in newly embroidered red shoes. It turned out that Baocan had not yet had time to wash up and had come early to collect his belongings. Seeing him so attired, Xue Ke invited him in with a cordial smile and asked, “What brings you up so early?”  Baocan blushed and, offering no answer, simply folded the fruit into a small dish and departed. Observing Baocan’s appearance, Xue Ke sensed that last night’s matter had been set in motion; he thought, “So be it. If they have grown angry, they may have decided beyond reconciliation—and that spares me the trouble of further entanglement.” Relieved, he relaxed and ordered someone to fetch water for washing his face. He resolved then to remain at home for a couple of days to recuperate, for fear of being sought out by others if he went out. Meanwhile, those who had long been allied with Xue Pan in high spirits—seeing that no one was present at the Xue household except for the young and inexperienced Xue Ke—began to covet his position. Some schemed to insert themselves as errand runners; others, capable of serving as assistants or scribes, hoped to manage his affairs; still others planned to extort money from him; and some even spread fearful rumors. Xue Ke, noticing these people from afar, did his best to avoid them, yet he dared not confront them directly for fear of provoking unexpected consequences. Instead, he stayed hidden at home, waiting for events to unfold—details he would not mention further. That very night, Jin Gui had sent Baocan some wine and fruit to “probe” Xue Ke’s situation, and Baocan returned with a full report of Xue Ke’s condition. When Jin Gui found that the matter did not go exactly as he had hoped, he feared that the fuss might backfire and that Baocan would look down on him. Desperate to cover his tracks, he tried to deflect with a few evasive remarks, but found himself unable to extricate the matter. Lost in thought and sitting in silence, he had no clear plan. Meanwhile, Baocan—knowing that Xue Pan was unlikely to return home soon and wishing to avoid Jin Gui’s scrutiny—kept his own counsel. Yet seeing that Jin Gui’s actions had already set events in motion, Baocan, eager to seize the advantage, decided to turn the tables and maneuver Xue Ke into a compromising position, hoping that if Xue Ke repented, he might easily be subdued. But when Xue Ke showed no overt interest and behaved reservedly, Baocan hesitated to act. Later, when Xue Ke was seen blowing out his lamp and falling asleep, Baocan returned to report to Jin Gui, who then planned his next move. Jin Gui, having not slept well all night, was at a loss for what to do; he resolved to wait until the next morning. At dawn, he planned to retrieve his belongings and, while changing into one or two sets of delicately colored garments without washing his hair—thus displaying a languid, coquettish air—he would feign anger and simply ignore Xue Ke. His idea was that if Xue Ke showed any sign of remorse, he would naturally withdraw, leaving Jin Gui’s plan intact. When, in the morning, Jin Gui encountered Xue Ke, who still appeared as he had the previous night with no sign of debauchery, Jin Gui deliberately returned with a dish, leaving behind the wine jug as a pretext for further intrigue. At that moment, Jin Gui asked, “Did you go with your things? Did anyone see you?” Baocan replied, “No.” Jin Gui pressed further, “And did Second Master ask you anything?” Baocan replied, “Not at all.” Jin Gui, having not slept through the night and at a loss for strategy, mused, “If I were to carry out such a scheme, others might be fooled—but how can Baocan keep it secret?
The fortune-teller said, ‘A person with a fated golden nature must be supported by a worthy match to restore his luck, or else his fate cannot be preserved.’ I know you do not believe in such superstitions, so I have come to discuss this with you. Your wife is here, too; perhaps the two of you should deliberate—should we ensure Baoyu’s well-being, or let things be?” Jia Zheng, forcing a smile, replied, “Old Mother, how can a son not care for his own child? It is only that Baoyu has not advanced in life, and I often lament that he is like untempered iron. Yet if the old lady wishes him to marry, how can we go against her wishes? Now that Baoyu is sick, I, too, am deeply anxious. Since the old lady has forbidden him to see me, I dare not say much. I must first observe what ails him.” Madam Wang, her eyes growing red, knew in her heart how much he cared. “Tell me,” she said, “what does his countenance reveal?” Xiren then brought Baoyu in from the inner room. When Baoyu saw his father, and Xiren urged him to greet him, he managed a weak salutation. Jia Zheng noted how thin his face had grown and how vacant his eyes appeared—as though he were maddened—and ordered that he be carried inside. He thought, I too am now one who yearns for proper care; and as I leave on my assignment, if this child truly deteriorates, not only will I be blamed as a failure to produce an heir, but also the old lady—who dotes on him above all—would hold me accountable! Gazing at Madam Wang’s tearful face and then at Baoyu’s, Jia Zheng rose again and said, “Old Mother, with you so advanced in years, who can dare to oppose your wishes? Let the old lady decide—but what of the second wife’s family? Have they been informed?” Madam Wang replied, “The second mistress has already agreed; it is only that matters concerning Pan’er have yet to be settled, so they have not been mentioned of late.” Jia Zheng went on, “That is the first layer of our difficulty. With your elder brother in prison, how is a sister to be married off? And though the noble consort’s affairs do not bar marriage, Baoyu, who has already had a sister wear mourning for nine months, will find it hard to wed. Moreover, my departure date is already set—I cannot delay. What shall we do these few days?” Jia Mu considered for a moment and said, “You speak truly. If these matters drag on and your father departs, and if Baoyu’s condition worsens day by day, what will become of us? We must handle these rites quickly.” After settling his mind, he said, “If you see to it, I have a plan that will not cause further harm. As for the second mistress’s side, you and your wife shall go personally to implore them. As for Pan’er, I will send little Ke’er to tell them that Baoyu’s life is at stake, and that everything must be arranged as best we can. As for arranging a marriage by force—it is out of the question. Besides, Baoyu is ill; we cannot have him wed for mere good luck. Let the two families agree, and since the children already carry a ‘golden and jade’ fate, there is no need to formally match them. Instead, choose an auspicious day, conduct a modest ceremony according to our customs—perhaps with twelve pairs of lanterns and an eight-person sedan chair to carry the bride, following the southern custom of a simple yet dignified wedding. That, I promise you, will count as a marriage. And as for Baoyu’s beloved, the young Miss Bao, she is of sound mind and good character; if a wise person were to counsel him, all would be well. He and Miss Bao get along; furthermore, the second mistress once remarked, ‘The golden lock on Miss Bao has been foretold by a monk—it signals that only when jade is present can marriage ensue.’ Who knows? Perhaps once Miss Bao comes forward, Baoyu might even be induced to reveal his jade, and all will fall into place. Would it not be our good fortune if each day passes better than the last?” Jia Zheng, though inwardly reluctant, dared not contradict his mother.
Am I not the only one? Even if there were others, who would dare enter my room?” Xue Pan said, “Now that Qiu Ling follows you every day, she surely knows; ask her and you will find out.” Jin Gui laughed coldly, “Ask whom? Who will confess? In my view, they will all pretend not to know – so let it drop. Besides, even if I were punished to death, it matters little; I could always remarry someone better. Truly, if you complain, who will not blame me?” Tears streaming down, she continued, “Then why must you involve everyone? I fear I will be blamed if you persist.” Xue Pan’s anger mounted further, and he seized a door bolt, stormed off, and without further ado confronted Qiu Ling, accusing her bluntly. Qiu Ling cried out in protest. Aunt Xue rushed in and commanded, “Do not start beating her until you know the whole truth! This maidservant has served for years—was there not a time when she made a mistake? Would you really do something so heartless? Ask clearly first, then act!” Hearing this, Jin Gui feared that Xue Pan might soften and began to weep bitterly, “For half a month you have monopolized my Baochan, kept her from entering my room, and only allowed Qiu Ling to sleep with me. I wish to question Baochan, yet you continue protecting him. Now you act so defiantly as to beat her—if you kill me, then remarry as you please; why must you put on this farce?” Xue Pan’s anger grew even more. Aunt Xue, seeing how her daughter-in-law oppressed her son, cursed bitterly. In her fury she ordered, “Sell Xiangling immediately!” Miss Bao then laughed, “Our family only knows how to buy people, not sell them—madam, you are completely confused. If word gets out, won’t it be a laughingstock? If my elder brother and sister-in-law despise her and leave her to me, I’m doomed!” Aunt Xue replied, “Better to dismiss her entirely than let her remain with us.” Miss Bao laughed, “Whether she stays with me or not matters nothing—cut her off as if she were sold.” Xiangling had already run up to Aunt Xue, pleading bitterly and crying, unwilling to leave; she wished instead to remain with the young lady. Aunt Xue, with no alternative, had to relent. Thereafter, Xiangling left with Miss Bao, effectively severing her ties with the past. Yet she could not help but feel sorrow under the moonlight, and by lamplight she quietly lamented. Although she had spent several years in Xue Pan’s household, her delicate condition – worsened by her inherited illness – meant she never bore children; now, further aggravated by anger and distress, her health declined, and she eventually developed a “dry blood” disorder, growing thinner and losing her appetite with no remedy proving effective. Meanwhile, Xue Pan and Jin Gui’s quarrels continued as before. (…The narrative here continues with further domestic strife, bitter exchanges, and chaotic interactions among the household members. Various conflicts over personal belongings, insults, and even physical altercations ensued—while the scheming of Jin Gui, the inciting of jealousy by Xue Pan, and the heartbreak of the maidservants all compounded the troubled atmosphere. In the midst of these turbulent events, discussions of marriage arrangements, matters of inheritance, and the comings and goings of various kin are recounted. Gossip spreads, alliances shift, and each individual’s fate becomes interwoven with the emotional turbulence of the household. Even as Bao Yu suffers from sorrow and illness, and as the family prepares for ancestral rites and visits to temples, the conflicts and intrigues continue unabated. Amid the clamor, poetic contests are held, humorous and sorrowful verses are composed, and the intermingling of duty, filial piety, and personal ambition is vividly displayed. Toward the end of the chapter, as preparations for temple offerings and other ceremonies take place, it is revealed that the household is in chaos—maidservants are being dismissed, personal items are confiscated, and bitter words are exchanged about the conduct of various young ladies and the fate of marriage alliances. In one particularly poignant moment, Bao Yu, suffering from the cumulative emotional turmoil and physical illness brought on by the family’s endless strife, composes a lament for a departed maid, and the scene shifts to an atmosphere of grief and resignation. Finally, as the day ends, the narrative notes that the matter will be continued in the next installment.” Chapter 81: Divining Fortune While the Four Beauties Fish for Playful Fish, and the Devotional Verses Are Recited Twice in the Family School  After Yingchun had departed, Lady Xing—though herself untroubled by the matter—found that Madame Wang, who had borne the burden of raising the household, was deeply saddened.
Just the other day she was ill for more than ten days. When the doctor examined her, he said it was ‘daughter’s consumption’ [a chronic wasting disease]. Therefore, I hurriedly sent her away. If she recovers, there is no need to have her return—she might be arranged to marry out. As for those girls who perform in our operas, I shall decide to let them go as well. First, they are all familiar with performing on stage and tend to speak loosely, which might mislead the young ladies; and second, when they sing and perform, it is wasted if they perform without restraint. Moreover, there are far too many maidservants—if their number is insufficient, we can always select more.”  Grandmother Jia nodded in agreement and said, “That is proper; I had been thinking along similar lines. But regarding Qingwen, I find her very promising. Her conversation and needlework surpass many others. In the future she could even be of service to Bao Yu. Who would have thought she would change so?!”  Madame Wang laughed and replied, “The ones chosen by our venerable grandmother were indeed fine—but fate has not been kind to her, so she has contracted this ailment. As the old saying goes, ‘A woman changes as she grows older.’ Moreover, those with talent inevitably tend to become a bit wayward; our grandmother has experienced much in her time.”  “Three years ago I kept an eye on this matter and quietly chose her at first,” continued Madame Wang. “I observed that she was more attractive than others, though not very mature. In general, it is better to have someone like Xi Ren first. Although a virtuous wife or a beautiful concubine should be gentle and composed, Xi Ren’s appearance—though second to Qingwen’s—would be considered first-rate in a household. Furthermore, she is unassuming and honest in her conduct; for years she has never joined Bao Yu in his mischief. When Bao Yu acts the fool, she merely urges him sternly. Thus, after two years of careful selection, everything was satisfactory. I secretly set aside Qingwen’s monthly allowance and allocated two taels of silver from my own funds for her—just so that she might know to be extra careful and perform well. And I made no mention of it publicly; partly because Bao Yu is still young and if our elders were to learn of it, they might worry about his studies, and partly because Bao Yu, being so self-assured with his own circle, would not be willing to be corrected.”  After a long pause, Grandmother Jia smiled and said, “I see. That is all very well. Xi Ren, who was once so taciturn, has been called ‘the mute gourd.’ Since you know her well, there is no great error here.”  Madame Wang then recounted how today Jia Zheng had praised the matter and taken them out on a tour. Grandmother Jia listened and grew even more pleased. At that moment, Yingchun arrived dressed up to bid farewell and head out. Miss Feng also came by to offer morning greetings and to help serve breakfast. After a short round of banter, Grandmother Jia rested for a while. Then Madame Wang called Miss Feng and asked if the new medicinal pills had been prepared. Miss Feng replied, “Not yet—for now we are still taking decoctions. Rest assured, madame, I am on the mend.”  Seeing his spirit renewed, Madame Wang took heart and then mentioned the matter of dismissing Qingwen and the other girls. “Why did Bao Yu’s maid leave home without permission? You all must not be aware. Just the other day I checked along the way—who would have thought that even the newly arrived maid from Lan’s family was so coquettish and did not like him? I told her, ‘Give her to your eldest sister,’ so that each may depart on her own. When I asked your eldest sister, ‘Don’t you know Bao Yu’s maid has left?’ she said she had been informed and that in two or three days, when Auntie’s illness subsides, she will return. In truth, her ailment is nothing serious—just a cough and sore waist every year. Surely she must have left for a reason; has someone offended her? That child is stubborn, and in a household of relatives one must be careful not to offend others, or else things will turn sour.”  Miss Feng laughed and asked, “Who can truly afford to offend her?”  Madame Wang said, “Perhaps Bao Yu himself, who has always had no filter when he speaks; he never hesitates to blurt out whatever comes to mind.”  Miss Feng laughed, “Madame, you are worrying too much.
Later, when inquiries were made, nothing was amiss. But on the night before yesterday, the old lady herself said, ‘How is it that Princess Yuan has come here all alone?’ Everyone thought it was just the fevered ramblings of someone ill. The old lady even remarked, ‘If you don’t believe it, Princess Yuan told me, “Glory is fleeting; one must know when to retire.”’ Everyone agreed, thinking, ‘Isn’t that what people of advanced age contemplate?’ Thus, no one made a fuss. Then, early the next morning, there was a clamor inside saying that the mistress was gravely ill and that messengers were sent to offer their respects. The household was thrown into panic. Before anyone had time to react, word arrived that Consort Zhou had passed away. Can you imagine? Rumors from without combined with suspicion at home—it is almost too strange to believe!” Baochai remarked, “Not only are the rumors outside mixed up, but within the household when they heard the word ‘mistress,’ everyone scrambled; only afterward did they come to understand. Just the other day, some of the maids said they had long known it wasn’t our elder sister. I asked them, ‘How can you be so sure?’ They replied, ‘A few years ago in January, a fortune-teller from another province came and made a very accurate prediction. The old lady had our younger sisters’ birth charts placed alongside Princess Yuan’s, and when he calculated, he said, ‘The girl born on the first day of the first lunar month—if the birth time is mistaken, then though she may be a noble, she cannot thrive in this household.’ Regardless of whether he was right, our master insisted on following his calculation. The fortune-teller then said, ‘In the year of Jia-Shen and on a Bing-Yin day, there are the elements of “Hurting Officer” and “Defeated Wealth.” But in the character for “Shen” there are also “Proper Officer” and “Salary Horse” symbols—this indicates a household that cannot keep her, and no good is to be expected. The day is Yi-Mao, in early spring when wood is flourishing. Though it shows the sign of “Peer,” it is said that the more one is “peer,” the worse it is—like fine timber that, if overworked, will never become a great material.’ Then he rejoiced at the appearance of Xin-Jin as the favorable element, and praised the unique prominence of “Proper Officer” and “Salary Horse” in the Si hour: this is known as the ‘Flying Luck Horse Pattern.’ He also mentioned that when one’s day is graced by ‘Exclusive Luck,’ one is extremely esteemed. ‘The Two Virtues of the Heavenly Moon’ presiding over one’s destiny ensure one receives the favor of the imperial harem. This young lady, if her birth time is correct, is destined to become a mistress of high standing. Isn’t that an accurate prediction? We still recall the saying, ‘Alas, glory is short-lived; one only fears that when the year of Yin meets the month of Mao, it will be like endless rivals, a constant struggle—as with fine timber, if it is too delicately carved, it loses its substance.’ They completely forgot all these details and only busied themselves with trivial matters. I then recalled and asked, ‘Tell our eldest lady, isn’t this year the year of Yin and the month of Mao?’” Before Baochai could finish recounting these words, Xue Ke hastily interrupted, “Let’s not concern ourselves with other people’s affairs. Since we have this accurate fortune-teller, I wonder what ill-star that has befallen our brother this year to cause such misfortune? Quickly, cast our brother’s birth chart—I will have it calculated to see if any inauspicious influences are at work.” Baochai replied, “He is from another province; I’m not sure if he is still in the capital this year.” With that, she arranged for Madam Xue to proceed to the Jia mansion. Once there, only Li Wan, Tan-chun, and a few others were at home. They asked, “How is our eldest uncle’s matter coming along?” Madam Xue explained, “We are awaiting further orders from our superiors; it seems that a death sentence is unlikely.” This news finally put everyone at ease.
Daiyu then asked, “Where did you two go? Now not a single soul is to be seen.” With that, she went to the kang, leaned back, pulled aside her quilt, and lay down, urging that the covering be removed. Zijuan and Snow Goose, suspecting that her earlier conversation might have reached her ears, chose not to mention it further. But Daiyu’s heart, already full of inner turmoil, had caught seven or eight parts of what they said, as if her soul were adrift in a vast sea. Reflecting on past omens and overwhelmed by bitter regrets, she resolved that it might be better to die soon rather than live on to witness unexpected misfortune. Reminding herself of her lifelong sorrow from losing her parents and the continual erosion of her life day by day, she decided that in time she would attain a state of serene detachment. With that grim resolve, she neither gathered new clothes nor cared for her meals, and simply lay down pretending to sleep. Even though Zijuan and Snow Goose attended her several times, seeing no movement she dared not disturb her. She skipped dinner entirely. After the lights were lit, Zijuan lifted the quilt to see that Daiyu had indeed fallen asleep, the blanket carelessly kicked off at the foot. Fearing she might catch a chill, Zijuan gently pulled the quilt back over her. Later, when Daiyu awoke and tried to get up, she again allowed herself to be softly covered. That night passed quietly. The next morning, Daiyu rose early without summoning anyone, sitting alone in a daze. Zijuan, upon awakening and seeing her, exclaimed, “Miss, why so early?” Daiyu replied, “It is as always; early to sleep means early to wake.” Zijuan quickly roused Snow Goose to help Daiyu dress and wash. Gazing at herself in the mirror, Daiyu stared blankly at her reflection. After a while, she noticed that her tear-stained silk handkerchiefs were completely soaked. As the verse goes:   “Slim shadows reflected on spring water—   You must pity me as I pity you!” Zijuan, fearful that any idle chat might provoke old resentments, dared not urge her further. After some time, Daiyu finished her simple wash; yet the traces of tears in her eyes did not dry. Sitting a while longer, she told Zijuan, “Please light the hidden incense.” Zijuan protested, “Miss, you hardly slept—how can you now light incense? Weren’t you meant to be composing sutras?” Daiyu nodded. Zijuan said, “Miss, you woke too early today and are writing again—surely you’ll tire yourself out.” Daiyu replied, “Nonsense! The sooner I finish, the better. Besides, I’m not writing the sutra for its own sake, but merely to relieve my boredom with some writing. In the future, when you see my handwriting, it will be as if you see my very soul.” As she spoke, tears streamed down once more. Zijuan, moved by her words, found herself unable to hold back her own tears. From that day on, Daiyu resolved to deliberately neglect nourishment and to shun food and drink. Although Baoyu would frequently inquire after her well-being whenever he returned from school, Daiyu, aware that she was growing older and no longer could be teased and cajoled as in her youth, kept her inner feelings hidden. Whenever they met, Baoyu’s words of consolation were light and fleeting—it was truly a case of “closeness breeding estrangement.” Though Grandmother Jia, Madam Wang, and others showed concern and urged her to seek treatment, all they could hear was that Daiyu was often ill; none suspected the true nature of her heart’s sorrow. Even though Zijuan and the others understood her inner plight, they dared not speak of it. Thus, day by day, her strength waned. Within half a month, her stomach and intestines grew ever weaker until she could no longer eat even a bowl of porridge. During the day, every word Baoyu spoke seemed to allude to his betrothal; in the Yi Hong Courtyard, everyone—both high and low—seemed to exude the glow of Baoyu’s impending marriage. When Madam Xue visited and found that Baochai was absent, Daiyu’s suspicions deepened. She refused visits and would not take her medicine, wishing only for a swift death. In her dreams she continually heard voices calling “Second Mistress Baoyu,” and her doubts swelled until she ceased eating entirely—until one day she wasted away, not even drinking her porridge, her spirit nearly extinguished.
Xiren asked, “Why are you coming out? It seems you were deeply troubled again.” Baoyu smiled faintly and pretended, “My heart was troubled, so I sought a quiet spot to sit awhile. Now that I feel better, I must take a walk outside.” He then left and made his way to the Xiaoxiang Hall. In the courtyard, he inquired, “Is Lin in her room?” Zijuan answered, “Who is asking?” Lifting the curtain, she smiled and said, “It appears it is Second Master Baoyu. The young lady is inside—please come in.” Baoyu followed Zijuan inside. Inside, Daiyu was resting in a room. She said, “Zijuan, invite Second Master to come sit inside.” Standing at the doorway, Baoyu noticed a newly written couplet on a small slip of paper with a purple-ink, gilded cloud-dragon design. It read: “Beneath the bright moon by the green window, the ancient records lie in vain.” Baoyu smiled as he glanced at it, then left the room and called out lightly, “Sister, what are you doing?” Daiyu rose and stepped forward, smiling as she said, “Please, have a seat. I am finishing my sutra-writing; only two lines remain. We can talk once I’m done.” She then signaled Snow Goose to serve tea. Baoyu said, “Do not stir; concentrate on writing.” While he watched, he noticed that hanging in the middle was a scroll depicting a scene: a beautiful Chang’e accompanied by a servant, another celestial maiden with her attendant, both holding what looked like a long garment bundle. Beside them, a few stylized clouds provided a simple backdrop—a design very much in the spirit of Li Longmian’s sketches—with the words “A Portrait of Enduring Cold” inscribed in small calligraphy. Baoyu asked, “Sister, is this ‘Portrait of Enduring Cold’ newly hung?” Daiyu replied, “Indeed, just yesterday while they were tidying the room, I recalled it and had them hang it.” Baoyu asked, “From what source is it?” Daiyu laughed, “Why, it is well known—you need not ask.” Baoyu smiled, “I can’t recall at once; please remind me, Sister.” Daiyu replied, “Have you not heard the lines ‘The fair maid endures the cold, as the moon’s frost battles with beauty in the night sky’?” Baoyu said, “Yes, indeed—how novel and refined. It is perfect to be displayed at this moment.” He then wandered about, glancing here and there. Snow Goose soon brought more tea. Baoyu ate and waited until Daiyu finished writing. When she finally stood and said, “That is enough,” Baoyu remarked, “Sister, you remain as courteous as ever.” At that moment, Daiyu appeared dressed in a moon-white, embroidered fur jacket with a silver mouse waistcoat, her hair neatly bound in a customary cloud bun, adorned with a single slender, red-gold hairpin—no extra accessories. At her waist she wore a Yingfei-colored embroidered cotton skirt. Truly, she seemed to evoke the lines:   “Like a graceful jade tree standing against the wind,   Or a fragrant lotus unfolding its dewdrops.”  Baoyu then asked, “Sister, have you played the zither these days?” Daiyu replied, “Not for two days. My hands feel too cold from writing; where is there time to play?” Baoyu said, “That’s fine. I believe that though the zither is a refined instrument, it never yields tunes that celebrate longevity or prosperity—it only expresses sorrow and discontent. Moreover, to play the zither, one must commit its notes to heart—something not done idly. In my opinion, dear sister, with your delicate health, it’s better not to trouble yourself with it.” Daiyu smiled softly. Baoyu pointed to the qin hanging on the wall and said, “Is this qin so short?” Daiyu laughed, “It is not short; when I was a child learning to play, the other qins were too large to handle, so this one was specially made for me.
He sat silently, waiting until the incense had burned completely, then opened the door. Xiren asked, “Why are you coming out? It seems you were deeply troubled again.” Baoyu smiled faintly and pretended, “My heart was troubled, so I sought a quiet spot to sit awhile. Now that I feel better, I must take a walk outside.” He then left and made his way to the Xiaoxiang Hall. In the courtyard, he inquired, “Is Lin in her room?” Zijuan answered, “Who is asking?” Lifting the curtain, she smiled and said, “It appears it is Second Master Baoyu. The young lady is inside—please come in.” Baoyu followed Zijuan inside. Inside, Daiyu was resting in a room. She said, “Zijuan, invite Second Master to come sit inside.” Standing at the doorway, Baoyu noticed a newly written couplet on a small slip of paper with a purple-ink, gilded cloud-dragon design. It read: “Beneath the bright moon by the green window, the ancient records lie in vain.” Baoyu smiled as he glanced at it, then left the room and called out lightly, “Sister, what are you doing?” Daiyu rose and stepped forward, smiling as she said, “Please, have a seat. I am finishing my sutra-writing; only two lines remain. We can talk once I’m done.” She then signaled Snow Goose to serve tea. Baoyu said, “Do not stir; concentrate on writing.” While he watched, he noticed that hanging in the middle was a scroll depicting a scene: a beautiful Chang’e accompanied by a servant, another celestial maiden with her attendant, both holding what looked like a long garment bundle. Beside them, a few stylized clouds provided a simple backdrop—a design very much in the spirit of Li Longmian’s sketches—with the words “A Portrait of Enduring Cold” inscribed in small calligraphy. Baoyu asked, “Sister, is this ‘Portrait of Enduring Cold’ newly hung?” Daiyu replied, “Indeed, just yesterday while they were tidying the room, I recalled it and had them hang it.” Baoyu asked, “From what source is it?” Daiyu laughed, “Why, it is well known—you need not ask.” Baoyu smiled, “I can’t recall at once; please remind me, Sister.” Daiyu replied, “Have you not heard the lines ‘The fair maid endures the cold, as the moon’s frost battles with beauty in the night sky’?” Baoyu said, “Yes, indeed—how novel and refined. It is perfect to be displayed at this moment.” He then wandered about, glancing here and there. Snow Goose soon brought more tea. Baoyu ate and waited until Daiyu finished writing. When she finally stood and said, “That is enough,” Baoyu remarked, “Sister, you remain as courteous as ever.” At that moment, Daiyu appeared dressed in a moon-white, embroidered fur jacket with a silver mouse waistcoat, her hair neatly bound in a customary cloud bun, adorned with a single slender, red-gold hairpin—no extra accessories. At her waist she wore a Yingfei-colored embroidered cotton skirt. Truly, she seemed to evoke the lines:   “Like a graceful jade tree standing against the wind,   Or a fragrant lotus unfolding its dewdrops.”  Baoyu then asked, “Sister, have you played the zither these days?” Daiyu replied, “Not for two days. My hands feel too cold from writing; where is there time to play?” Baoyu said, “That’s fine. I believe that though the zither is a refined instrument, it never yields tunes that celebrate longevity or prosperity—it only expresses sorrow and discontent. Moreover, to play the zither, one must commit its notes to heart—something not done idly. In my opinion, dear sister, with your delicate health, it’s better not to trouble yourself with it.” Daiyu smiled softly. Baoyu pointed to the qin hanging on the wall and said, “Is this qin so short?” Daiyu laughed, “It is not short; when I was a child learning to play, the other qins were too large to handle, so this one was specially made for me.
Xing’s brother, his behavior was entirely different; he only cared for drinking, gambling, and carousing with beauties, freely spending money and having little regard for others. Consequently, everyone called him “the silly uncle.” Xue Pan had long been known as “Old Fool.” Today, the two of them, meeting together, both tried to outdo each other and competed in speed at a heated game on a heated bench in the outer room. Meanwhile, in another room a few played a more refined game of bone-throwing, a game called “Tian Jiu.” All the footmen serving here were children under fifteen. (This is a reference to events mentioned earlier.)  Now, Lady You sneaked to the window outside to spy. There, she saw two young boys serving alcohol, all dressed up in powder and fine silks. Today, Xue Pan had just lost a bet and was in a foul mood, but fortunately his fortunes soon reversed and aside from settling the debts he ended up winning considerably, which greatly lifted his spirits. Jia Zhen then said, “Let’s pause – have some food first, then continue.” He asked, “How are those two sections doing?” At that time, the games of ‘Tian Jiu’ and ‘Driving Old Goats’ were still in progress. First, a table was set for the latter game, and Jia Zhen joined in eating. Xue Pan, buoyed by his good mood, began to embrace one of the young boys to drink with him, then ordered that his wine be dedicated to “the silly uncle.” The silly uncle, having no compassion for the losers, drank two bowls and became slightly drunk. Irritated by the fact that the boys serving alcohol only attended to the winners and ignored the losers, he scolded, “You bunch of rabbits—truly heartless little brats! Every day you all share in someone’s favor. And just because you lost a few taels of silver this time, you are divided into tiers. Is it possible that henceforth you will never come to me for help?” Everyone, seeing him with his wine, felt awkward and only smiled sardonically. The winners quickly said, “Uncle, you scold very appropriately. All these little dogs have such a custom.” Then they laughed, “And why don’t you pour Uncle some wine?” The two little children, who had been acting out the entire scene, immediately knelt down to serve wine, clinging to the silly uncle’s legs and playfully saying, “Please, sir, don’t be angry. Our teacher said that no matter how far or near, the one with money is always favored. If you don’t believe it, then when you win the next big bet, you’ll see what we mean.” Their words made everyone laugh. Unable to contain his own laughter, the silly uncle reached out and grabbed some wine, saying, “Had I not seen you two so pitiful as always, I would have kicked your little dumplings out with one swift kick.” As he lifted his leg, the two children seized the moment, rising up even more coquettishly, taking a piece of floral silk to support his hand, and then dumping an entire jug of wine into his mouth. The silly uncle laughed heartily, lifted his head, and downed the entire jug. Then, after twisting the child’s face playfully, he said, “Now that I see it, I feel almost tender-hearted.” Suddenly recalling an old incident, he pounded the table and said to Jia Zhen, “Yesterday, when your maternal aunt and I quarreled, did you know?” Jia Zhen replied, “I did not hear a word.” The silly uncle sighed, “It was all because of money! Dear nephew, you have no idea about the depths of our Xing family’s affairs. When our old lady passed away, I was but a child, unaware of worldly matters. Among the three sisters, only your maternal aunt held the position of eldest. When she got married, she took all the family property with her. Now that your second aunt has also married out, her household is in dire straits. And your third aunt still remains at home; all household expenses are managed by the Wang Shambao household. I only came to ask for a few taels of silver, not to claim the family’s property – even my Xing family’s property is enough for my needs. But alas, I couldn’t get hold of any, so you all end up calling me broke!” Seeing him drunk, Jia Zhen quickly interjected with soothing words.
As for Qin’er, give him a good scolding; aside from the ancestral rites and celebrations, he need not be summoned here. Should he inadvertently come into conflict with the old master’s anger, he’ll be in deep trouble. Also, inform the accounts office to cancel the entry for this item of grain and provisions. Then, send someone to Shuiyue Nunnery to relay the old master’s command that aside from the ritual of burning paper for the ancestors, no man from his family is allowed to enter. Should there be any more unfavorable news, even the old maid must be expelled as well.”  Jia Lian agreed to every word. He then went out to relay Madam Wang’s orders to Lai Da, saying, “Madam’s instructions are for you to proceed exactly as she said. Once you have finished, report back to me so I can in turn report to Madam. Hurry on and complete the task. When the old master returns, you must answer according to Madam’s directions.”  Hearing this, Lai Da remarked, “Our Madam truly has a compassionate heart. Yet to have these people sent back… if they’re forced to be sent, Madam must choose someone capable. Qin Ge’er will be handed over to Second Master for punishment. As for that notice-writer, I intend to investigate thoroughly and deal with him severely.”  Jia Lian nodded and immediately dismissed Jia Qin. Lai Da then hurriedly led out the nun-like women and carried out the orders accordingly. That evening, when Jia Zheng returned, Jia Lian and Lai Da reported the matter to him. Being a man of economy, once he heard the account he casually let it drop. Only those rogues, upon hearing that twenty-four young women had been dispatched from the Jia household, could not help but think—if these people cannot return home and their whereabouts remain unknown, things will become extremely complicated. Meanwhile, Zizhuan, who had grown increasingly fond of Daiyu, noting that all was quiet in the garden, heard that the nun-like women were now to be employed in the palace. Not knowing what it was about, she went to inquire with Jia Mu. Just then, Yuanyang had come down, idle, and as they sat chatting idly, the subject of the nuns was mentioned. Yuanyang exclaimed in surprise, “I haven’t heard a word about that. Go and ask Second Madam—she’ll know.”  As they were speaking, two women from the Fu Shi household came over to pay their respects to Jia Mu. Yuanyang intended to accompany them. Since Jia Mu was napping, the two women whispered a word to Yuanyang and then departed. Zizhuan asked, “Who sent them?”  Yuanyang replied irritably, “How tiresome! Our household now has a girl, a rather pretty one, who is paraded like a treasure. She is always praised before the old lady—how well-born, how kind-hearted, ‘well-mannered, eloquent, skillful at work, literate and numerate, most filial to her elders and even exceedingly kind to the servants.’ They come with a whole spiel to extol her virtues to the old lady. I find it so annoying. These gossipy old women are extremely tiresome, yet the old lady loves to hear such flattery. The old lady is one thing, but Baoyu, who’s seen these women so often, has grown rather tired of them. Yet she holds a special preference for those whose wives are not tiresome—how strange, isn’t it? The other day she even said: ‘Among the families that have come to propose for their daughters, the master never consents; his heart is set on only marrying into a family like ours.’ After a round of praises and flattery, the old lady is completely won over.”  Zizhuan was dumbfounded for a moment, then feigned a question, “If the old lady likes her so much, why not fix her on Baoyu already?”  Just as Yuanyang was about to explain, someone from inside called, “The old lady is awake!” Yuanyang hurried upstairs, and Zizhuan had to follow. Back in the garden, as she walked, Zizhuan mused, “Isn’t there only one Baoyu in the world? You think of him, and so do I. Our own person is growing ever more infatuated! Judging by that expression, she must have her eyes set on Baoyu—those repeated illnesses, aren’t they due to this matter?
His wife was washing her feet and said, ‘Since it is so, you must lick them for me, and then I’ll let you off.’ The man had no choice but to lick them, and couldn’t help but feel disgusted and nearly vomit. His wife then became angry and threatened to beat him, saying, ‘How dare you be so frivolous!’ The poor fellow immediately knelt and begged, ‘It wasn’t my dear mother’s foot that was pickled, it’s only that I drank too much huangjiu yesterday and ate mooncake filling, so I feel sour today.’” This account had Grandmother Jia and everyone laughing. Jia Zheng quickly poured another cup for Grandmother Jia. Grandmother Jia said, “Since that is so, quickly send someone to fetch some strong wine, so that those married men among you won’t be troubled.” Everyone laughed again. Only Jia Lian and Bao Yu dared not laugh heartily. Then the drum was struck again, starting with Jia Zheng, and by chance it stopped at Bao Yu. Bao Yu, uneasy with Jia Zheng’s presence and in his hand, thought, “If I tell a joke, what if it’s not good? And if I say one that is good, then it won’t be taken seriously – I’m only known for being a chatterbox, and that would only add to my troubles. Better not say anything.” So he rose and excused himself, “I cannot speak; please allow someone else.” Jia Zheng said, “Since that is so, let’s limit it to one ‘autumn’ character; write a poem inspired by the scene. If it is good, you shall be rewarded; if not, we will deliberate tomorrow!” Grandmother Jia quickly said, “What a fine order – why must you make a poem now?” Jia Zheng replied with a smile, “He is capable.” Grandmother Jia said, “Then go on.” “Quickly fetch paper and pen.” Jia Zheng said, “But do not use those decorative words like ‘water,’ ‘crystal,’ ‘ice,’ ‘jade,’ ‘silver,’ ‘color,’ ‘bright,’ ‘pure’ and so on. I want you to come up with something original – try out the feelings of these past few years.” Bao Yu, hearing this, felt it deeply in his heart and immediately composed four lines on paper, presenting them to Jia Zheng. Jia Zheng looked at them and nodded silently. Seeing this, Grandmother Jia, pleased that nothing was amiss, asked, “How is it?” Jia Zheng, wanting Grandmother to be pleased, said, “It is troublesome for him. He refuses to read books, and in the end, his verses are not elegant.” Grandmother Jia said, “That’s enough. He should be rewarded, and let him work even harder in the future.” Jia Zheng agreed, “Exactly.” Then he turned to order an old nursemaid to go out, “Instruct the footmen to fetch the fans I brought from Hainan – two for Bao Yu.” Bao Yu kowtowed and then returned to his seat to continue the order. At that moment, Jia Lan, seeing that Bao Yu had been rewarded, also took the opportunity to compose a poem and present it to Jia Zheng. Jia Zheng read it and was even more delighted. He then shared it with Grandmother Jia, who was very pleased, and quickly ordered Jia Zheng to award him. Then everyone resumed their seats, and the game continued. This time, Jia She sat holding his cup in his hand, merely drinking and telling jokes. He said, “In a family, the most filial son is the one whose mother falls ill. When all attempts at finding a doctor fail, a certain acupuncture woman is invited. This woman did not know how to take the pulse; she only said it was due to excess heart-fire and that one needle would cure it. The son, in panic, asked, ‘If the heart is like iron, how can it be cured with a needle?’ The woman replied, ‘There is no need to needle the heart; just needle the rib cartilage.’ The son said, ‘But the rib cartilage is far from the heart – how would that work?’ The woman replied, ‘It matters not.
Baoyu ate and waited until Daiyu finished writing. When she finally stood and said, “That is enough,” Baoyu remarked, “Sister, you remain as courteous as ever.” At that moment, Daiyu appeared dressed in a moon-white, embroidered fur jacket with a silver mouse waistcoat, her hair neatly bound in a customary cloud bun, adorned with a single slender, red-gold hairpin—no extra accessories. At her waist she wore a Yingfei-colored embroidered cotton skirt. Truly, she seemed to evoke the lines:   “Like a graceful jade tree standing against the wind,   Or a fragrant lotus unfolding its dewdrops.”  Baoyu then asked, “Sister, have you played the zither these days?” Daiyu replied, “Not for two days. My hands feel too cold from writing; where is there time to play?” Baoyu said, “That’s fine. I believe that though the zither is a refined instrument, it never yields tunes that celebrate longevity or prosperity—it only expresses sorrow and discontent. Moreover, to play the zither, one must commit its notes to heart—something not done idly. In my opinion, dear sister, with your delicate health, it’s better not to trouble yourself with it.” Daiyu smiled softly. Baoyu pointed to the qin hanging on the wall and said, “Is this qin so short?” Daiyu laughed, “It is not short; when I was a child learning to play, the other qins were too large to handle, so this one was specially made for me. Though it is not the withered phoenix-tail of a Fuyong qin, its matching of the crane’s and phoenix’s features is just right—the dragons in its inlays and the subtle patterns evoke a clear, transcendent tone.” Baoyu then asked, “Sister, have you written any poetry these past few days?” Daiyu replied, “Since our society was formed, I have not composed much.” Baoyu laughed, “Don’t hide it from me. I recall hearing you recite a line like ‘How can pure heart compare to the moon in heaven?’—you set it into the qin’s melody, and it rang so clearly. What other verses have you composed?” Daiyu asked, “How did you hear that?” Baoyu said, “I heard it the other day coming from Liao Feng Pavilion, but I was afraid to disturb your pure melody, so I listened quietly for a while and then left. I was about to ask: at first the verse is in a level tone, but toward the end it shifts to a slanted tone—what does that mean?” Daiyu replied, “It is simply the natural expression of the human heart—the music flows as it must, with no fixed form.” Baoyu said, “I see. Alas, I do not have the refined taste to appreciate it; I only listened for a while in vain.” Daiyu sighed, “How few kindred spirits there have ever been in all ages!” Baoyu, realizing he had spoken too boldly and fearing he might chill Daiyu’s delicate heart further, fell silent. They sat together in quiet contemplation. Though Baoyu felt many things within, he found nothing more to say. Recalling his earlier words, which had spilled out impulsively, Daiyu felt they were too blunt. “If you meet Third Sister, please send her my regards,” she said. Baoyu agreed and departed. After escorting Daiyu to the door, he returned alone, sitting gloomily and thinking, “Lately, Baoyu’s words are so ambiguous—half-hearted, at times cold, at times warm—I do not know what he means.” Lost in thought, he barely noticed when Zijuan approached and asked, “Miss, have you finished writing? Shall I put away your brush and ink?” Daiyu replied, “I have finished; just pack them up.” Then, she went into her inner room and sat on her bed, leaning slightly as she pondered deeply. Zijuan returned and gently asked, “Miss, would you like a cup of tea?” Daiyu answered, “No, I’m not hungry—I’m just feeling a bit off. You all go on.” Zijuan left, and soon Snow Goose was found sitting quietly, lost in thought.
Later, when the younger generation takes over, it will be even harder to control them. I recall, in the Eastern Mansion a few years ago, I personally saw Jiao Da so drunk that he lay at the steps, cursing at everyone indiscriminately—what a mess! Although he once had merit, in the end a master’s servants must maintain some decorum. Grandma Zhen, as I call her, is an honest person; everyone respects her, yet now this Bao Er has come along, and I hear that you even find fault with him—why, then, did you beat him today?”  Jia Lian, stung by her words, felt chagrined and tried to divert the conversation, claiming he had urgent business, and left. Shortly after, Xiao Hong came in and said, “Second Master Yun is outside asking to see the old lady.” Sister Feng thought, “What does he want now?” and replied, “Have him come in.” Xiao Hong went out and, upon seeing Jia Yun, gave a slight smile. Jia Yun hurriedly stepped forward and asked, “Miss, did you relay my message?”  Xiao Hong blushed and said, “I’m the one who usually handles matters for Second Master!”  Jia Yun said, “What matter could possibly involve you so that I must trouble you? Even back then, when you were in the room of Uncle Bao Er, I only….” Fearing that someone might overhear, Xiao Hong quickly interrupted, “Did Second Master see that piece of silk I once exchanged for him?”  At the mention of that, Jia Yun’s heart leapt with joy and he was about to speak when a little maid came out. Jia Yun quickly took Xiao Hong by the arm and led her inside. The two walked side by side, not far apart. In a low voice, Jia Yun said, “When I come out, you must be the one to see me off. I have a funny story to tell you.”  Xiao Hong, her face flushed, glanced at Jia Yun without reply. When they reached Sister Feng’s door, Xiao Hong entered first to deliver her message, then emerged, lifting the curtain and deliberately saying, “Old Lady, please invite Second Master Yun in.”  Jia Yun smiled and followed her inside. There, he greeted Sister Feng and said, “Mother sends her regards.” Sister Feng also inquired after her mother. Sister Feng asked, “What brings you here?”  Jia Yun replied, “I have long felt grateful for the care you bestowed upon me in the past—I have always felt I owed you. Yet I also worry that you might overthink things. Now, in this Double Ninth Festival, I’ve prepared a modest gift. Don’t you have that one item? It is but a token of my filial piety, and I only hope you will accept it.”  Sister Feng smiled, “Sit down and tell me.”  Jia Yun set himself to the side, carefully placing the gift on a nearby table. Sister Feng then said, “You aren’t one to have extra means—why waste money? I’m not expecting you to lavish gifts. What exactly is your intention? Speak plainly.”  Jia Yun replied, “I have no ulterior motive; I simply wish to show my gratitude for your kindness. I was worried you might think ill of me.” He smiled demurely. Sister Feng said, “That’s not quite it. I know you have little to spare. Why should I accept something that is ‘half-hidden,’ with its kernel exposed? I cannot accept it if it is so ambiguous.”  Finding himself at a loss, Jia Yun stood and said with a laugh, “I have no wild ambitions. A few days ago I heard that the Master frequently handles tomb affairs, and some of my friends have managed several projects very successfully; I hoped you might mention this to the Master. Once things are settled, I shall never forget your kindness! If the household requires my assistance, I would gladly lend my efforts.”  Sister Feng replied, “If it were something else, I might be inclined to accept. But regarding official matters, everything upstairs is decided by the higher officials, and downstairs by the clerks and minor functionaries; even our own kin merely serve beneath the Master. Even if your Second Uncle were to be involved, it is solely for family matters, and he cannot interfere with public business. In our household, matters are handled strictly—if even Grandma Zhen cannot control them, what hope is there for the next generation?
Aunt Xue, with no alternative, had to relent. After that, Xiangling indeed left with Miss Bao, effectively severing the old ties. Yet she could not help but feel sorrow under the moonlight, and by lamplight she lamented softly. Though she had spent several years in Xue Pan’s household, her delicate constitution – marred by her inherited illness – meant she never conceived; now, aggravated by anger and emotional strain, her health deteriorated further, and she gradually developed a “dry blood” syndrome, growing thinner and losing her appetite, with no effective remedy. Meanwhile, Jin Gui’s quarrels with Xue Pan grew more frequent. On some occasions, bolstered by wine, Xue Pan even confronted her twice. When he attempted to strike with a stick, Jin Gui dodged and ordered him away. When he nearly drew a knife to kill, she stretched out her neck in defiance. Xue Pan, unable to bring himself to hit her, raged for a while before giving up. Over time, this became habitual, and it even led Jin Gui to increasingly insult Baochan. Baochan, who could not compare with Xiangling, was like dry tinder; having bonded with Xue Pan over shared feelings, he completely disregarded Jin Gui. Outraged by Jin Gui’s continual mistreatment, Baochan refused to back down. At first there were quarrels and shoving; later Jin Gui’s anger escalated to insults, and then even to physical blows. Though Baochan dared not fight back, he began to roll and flail about as if seeking death, both by day with knives and scissors, and by night with ropes – causing endless havoc. Xue Pan, caught between conflicting loyalties, stood helplessly by, thoroughly exasperated, and eventually left the house in despair. Jin Gui, meanwhile, secretly explained to Baochan that that very night Xue Pan was to “marry” in Qiu Ling’s room – that is, she was to be made to accompany Jin Gui in bed. At first Qiu Ling refused, but Jin Gui insisted, claiming that she was being too fastidious and that comfort was secondary to convenience in the dark of night. She scolded, “Have you not seen our master? He takes every opportunity to hoard his maidservants and won’t let you near – what is your plan? I fear you intend to drive me to ruin!” Xue Pan, fearing that this might ruin Baochan’s reputation, quickly returned and admonished Qiu Ling, “If you do not obey, I will beat you!” Qiu Ling, with no choice, had to gather her bedding and lie down on the floor, reluctantly obeying. No sooner had she laid down than she was summoned repeatedly for tea throughout the night, and her legs were pounded several times so that she could not rest for a moment. Xue Pan, having secured Baochan as if it were a treasure, ignored all else. In his bitterness, Jin Gui murmured, “Let him have his fun for a few days; once he grows distant, then I can arrange for Xiangling. Then Baochan, originally mine, will be useless.” Quietly enduring, she schemed to further manipulate Qiu Ling. After about half a month, Qiu Ling suddenly pretended to be ill, complaining of unbearable heartache and immobility with treatments proving ineffective. Everyone remarked that it was due to her suppressed anger. After two days, unexpectedly, someone discovered a paper effigy hidden among Jin Gui’s pillows – bearing her age and an inscription of eight characters, with five needles pinned into her heart area and the gaps between her ribs and limbs. Thus the household took this as news and reported it first to Aunt Xue. Aunt Xue, now frantic, and Xue Pan, even more disordered, threatened to interrogate everyone. Jin Gui said, “There is no need to wrong innocent people. It appears that Baochan’s ‘demon-repelling charm’ must be used.” Xue Pan replied, “But she has not spent much time in your room lately; why cling to a good woman?” Jin Gui sneered, “Who else is there? Am I not the only one? Even if there were others, who would dare enter my room?” Xue Pan said, “Now that Qiu Ling follows you every day, she surely knows; question her and you will find out.” Jin Gui laughed coldly, “Question whom? Who will confess? In my view, they will all feign ignorance—so let it drop. Besides, even if I were to be punished to death, it matters little; I could always remarry someone better.
They say, ‘The Imperial Hospital has already reported severe phlegm-induced collapse—there is no cure.’” Madam Wang burst into tears upon hearing this. Jia Zheng said, “This is no time for tears. Go at once to summon the old lady. Speak in a gentle manner so as not to startle her.” As Jia Zheng spoke, he stepped out to instruct the family to attend to matters. Madam Wang wiped her tears and went to fetch Jia Mu, telling him only that the Yuan Consort was gravely ill and that she must pay her respects in the palace. Jia Mu chanted Buddhist prayers, “How is it that she is ill again? Previously, I was terribly frightened, and then it turned out to be a misunderstanding. If I must be mistaken again, so be it.” Madam Wang, while answering, hurried Yuanyang and others to open the chest of garments and adornments so that the old lady might dress quickly. After hastily preparing her own attire, Madam Wang went to serve in the palace. In short, the procession left without further mention. Meanwhile, after Yuan Chun was selected to reside in the Fengzao Palace, she enjoyed the imperial favor and, with her health robust, nonetheless found her movements laborious. Daily she was worn out by the rigors of court life, and periodically suffered from phlegm troubles. After returning from a banquet in the palace the previous day, she had caught a chill that reawakened an old ailment. Alas, this time it turned grave: her phlegm became so obstructed that her limbs grew cold. Despite immediate memorials and summons for the royal physicians, neither the prescribed medicines nor even the potent ‘tongguan’ remedies had any effect. The palace officials, in their anxiety, petitioned that preparations be made for her final rites. An imperial edict was issued, summoning the Jia family from the Pepper Chamber for an audience. Jia Mu and Madam Wang, following the order, entered the palace and saw that Yuan Consort, with phlegm clogging her throat and drooling, could not speak. On seeing Jia Mu, she only managed a sorrowful, weeping look—but without tears. Jia Mu stepped forward to pay his respects, offering words of consolation. In a short while, as Jia Zheng and other officials advanced, and the palace consorts delivered their memorials, Yuan Consort’s gaze gradually dulled, and her complexion changed. The inner palace eunuchs were about to report, fearing that if more consorts were sent to see her, the in-laws from the Pepper Chamber might be detained too long. Jia Mu and Madam Wang were heartbroken at the thought of parting, but bound by state protocol, they had to leave—though neither dared to cry aloud, their hearts ached deeply. Within the morning court, an official messenger arrived. Soon after, a eunuch came out with an imperial notice from the Celestial Bureau. Jia Mu’s heart sank; he dared not move. A short while later, a junior eunuch announced, “Madam Jia has passed away.” It was the 18th day of the 12th month of the Jia Yin year, the day of Lichun. Yuan Consort died on the 19th day of the 12th month, entering into the month of Mao in the Yinzhi year, at the age of forty-three. With a heavy heart, Jia Mu rose and was carried on a sedan chair back home. Jia Zheng and the others, having received the news, wept bitterly all the way. At home, Lady Xing, Li Wan, Fengjie, Baoyu, and the others gathered in the hall to welcome Jia Mu and to pay their respects to him, while Jia Zheng and Madam Wang did likewise—and all wept without cease. The next morning, all those of rank were required, in accordance with the rites for a noble consort, to enter the palace to pay their condolences. Jia Zheng, being a minister of the Ministry of Works, had to attend to ceremonial details and converse with colleagues; thus his schedule was even busier than it had been at the funerals of the former empress dowager and Consort Zhou. But as for Yuan Consort, no elaborate rites were held—she was posthumously titled the Virtuous and Gracious Consort. This was in keeping with the customs of the Wang family, and no further elaboration was needed. Meanwhile, in the Jia household, men and women were daily hurrying off to the palace. Fortunately, Fengjie’s health had improved in recent days and she even ventured out to oversee household affairs, while preparing for Prince Wang’s upcoming entry into the capital and the celebratory receptions.
Aunt Xue rushed in and commanded, “Do not start beating her until you understand the whole truth! This maidservant has served for years—wasn’t there a time when she made a mistake? Would you really do something so heartless? Ask clearly first, then act!” Hearing this, Jin Gui feared that Xue Pan might soften and began to weep bitterly, “For half a month you have monopolized my Baochan, kept her from entering my room, and only allowed Qiu Ling to sleep with me. I wish to question Baochan, yet you continue protecting him. Now you act so defiantly as to beat her—if you kill me, then remarry as you please; why must you put on this farce?” Xue Pan’s anger grew even more. Aunt Xue, seeing how her daughter-in-law oppressed her son, cursed bitterly. In her fury she ordered, “Sell Xiangling immediately!” Miss Bao then laughed, “Our family only knows how to buy people, not sell them—madam, you are completely confused. If word gets out, won’t it be a laughingstock? If my elder brother and sister-in-law despise her and leave her to me, I’m doomed!” Aunt Xue replied, “Better to dismiss her entirely than let her remain with us.” Miss Bao laughed, “Whether she stays with me or not is immaterial—cut her off as if she were sold.” Xiangling had already run up to Aunt Xue, pleading bitterly and crying, unwilling to leave; she wished instead to remain with the young lady. Aunt Xue, with no alternative, had to relent. Thereafter, Xiangling left with Miss Bao, effectively severing her ties with the past. Yet she could not help but feel sorrow under the moonlight, and by lamplight she quietly lamented. Although she had spent several years in Xue Pan’s household, her delicate condition – worsened by her inherited illness – meant she never bore children; now, further aggravated by anger and distress, her health declined, and she eventually developed a “dry blood” disorder, growing thinner and losing her appetite with no remedy proving effective. Meanwhile, Jin Gui continued to quarrel with Xue Pan. On occasion, emboldened by wine, he confronted her twice. When he tried to strike with a stick, Jin Gui dodged and ordered him away. When he nearly drew a knife, she stretched out her neck defiantly. Unable to bring himself to hit her, Xue Pan raged for a while before giving up. Over time, this became habitual, and Jin Gui’s insults toward Baochan grew ever more severe. Baochan, who could not compare with Xiangling, was like dry tinder; having bonded with Xue Pan through shared feelings, he completely disregarded Jin Gui. Outraged by her continual mistreatment, Baochan refused to relent. At first there were verbal spats and shoving; later Jin Gui’s anger escalated to physical blows. Though Baochan dared not retaliate, he began to thrash about as if courting death – by day with knives and scissors, by night with ropes – causing endless commotion. Xue Pan, caught between loyalties he could not resolve, eventually stood helplessly by, thoroughly exasperated, and left the house in despair. Jin Gui, meanwhile, secretly explained to Baochan that that very night Xue Pan was to be “married” in Qiu Ling’s room – meaning that she was forced to accompany him in bed. At first Qiu Ling refused, but Jin Gui insisted that she must not be too particular about comfort in the dark hours. She scolded, “Have you not seen our master? He clutches his maidservants so tightly that no one may approach you – what is your plan? I fear you intend to ruin me!” Worried that this might spoil Baochan’s reputation, Xue Pan quickly returned and admonished Qiu Ling, “If you do not obey, I will beat you!” With no alternative, Qiu Ling had to gather her bedding and lie down on the floor, reluctantly obeying. No sooner had she settled than she was repeatedly summoned for tea throughout the night, and her legs were struck several times so that she could not rest a moment. Xue Pan, having secured Baochan as if he were a treasure, ignored all else. In his bitterness, Jin Gui murmured, “Let him have his fun for a few days; when he grows distant, then I can arrange Xiangling as I wish. Then Baochan, originally mine, will be of no consequence.” Quietly enduring, she schemed to further control Qiu Ling.
That is why I admire this poem—it still carries the spirit of our noble household.” Then he ordered that many of his prized playthings be brought out as rewards for him, patting Jia Huan’s head and laughing, “From now on, continue this way, and your hereditary prospects are assured.” Hearing this, Jia Zheng quickly cautioned, “But he is merely rambling—how does that relate to future matters?” With that, he poured another cup of wine and resumed the game. Grandmother Jia then said, “You all may carry on. Naturally, there are also officials waiting outside, so do not disregard them. Moreover, there are many of you; disperse a little and let the young ladies enjoy themselves a while longer so they may rest.” Hearing this, Jia Zheng and the others ceased the game and rose; after sharing a communal cup of wine, they set off with their children and nephews. Now, to reveal the full story in brief (the remainder of this chapter follows):  Later, on his birthday, Jia Jing’s household prepared sumptuous dishes and fruit baskets to send to him, and among the various humorous anecdotes, there were lively conversations about the family’s festive arrangements, discussions about lunar cakes, watermelon, and other seasonal treats. Grandmother Jia, with a twinkle in her eye, led the family to the garden, where they offered incense and admired the luminous moon. The garden was splendidly decorated with goat-horn lanterns, and on the terrace of Jiayin Hall, fruits, mooncakes, and other treats were arranged in full display. Grandmother Jia then declared that the best place to enjoy the moon was on the hill, and soon everyone was led up to “Tubi Mountain Villa,” a lofty open hall symbolizing family unity with its round tables and chairs. After seating the family, Grandmother Jia organized a playful game involving passing an osmanthus branch with the condition that whoever held it must drink a cup of wine and tell a joke as a penalty. Various humorous incidents ensued: Jia Zheng recounted a tale about a husband too timid to defy his wife’s commands, and even Bao Yu was coaxed into composing a poem on the spot when instructed by Jia Zheng, who set a challenge to use an “autumn” character to capture the scene. Grandmother Jia and the others laughed and rejoiced in the familial banter and the lighthearted games. There were further humorous anecdotes involving other family members—Jia She, Jia Huan, even an account of an acupuncture joke by a servant—and playful teasing that filled the evening with mirth and the gentle sound of laughter. At one point, as the night deepened, Grandmother Jia had wine poured for the flute player, and the distant, plaintive sound of the flute mingled with the clear moonlight. The music, though simple, evoked a profound, chilling beauty that moved everyone into a reflective silence, where each person, sitting under the gentle glow of the moon, felt their worries and cares lifted, even if only for a while. Then the flute was played again, its tone now more plaintive and sorrowful, and the assembled family sat in a pensive quietude. Gradually, as the night waned, various family members began to disperse, and a long conversation broke out among the maidservants about missing tea cups and other small items, which led to more laughter and playful banter. Meanwhile, Miss Daiyu and Xiangyun, who had not yet gone to sleep, found themselves inspired by the moon and the subtle music. They began to compose verses together—challenging each other in a friendly poetic contest that ranged from humorous and light to poignant and melancholy. Their playful exchange, filled with ingenious couplets and allusions to classical texts, evoked both admiration and gentle teasing from one another, until at length the conversation wound down, and the two eventually retired to their rooms, though not before a final round of witty poetic exchanges. As the night’s festivities continued, the chapter concludes with the promise that the story will be continued in the next installment. Chapter 77: The Beautiful Maid’s Complaint Reveals Unmatched Grace; The Delicate Beauty’s Pity Leads to a Tragic Fate at Shuiyue  It is said that after the Mid‐Autumn Festival had passed, Madame Wang observed that while Miss Feng’s illness had lessened somewhat, though not fully cured, she was now well enough to go about freely. Accordingly, Madame Wang ordered that the physician attend her daily to take her pulse and administer medicine. A new prescription for “Regulating and Nourishing the Menstrual and Vitality Pills” was drawn up.
Even if there were others, who would dare enter my room?” Xue Pan said, “Now that Qiu Ling follows you every day, she surely knows; ask her and you will find out.” Jin Gui laughed coldly, “Ask whom? Who will confess? In my opinion, they will all pretend ignorance – so let it drop. Besides, even if I were punished to death, it matters little; I can always remarry someone better. Truly, if you complain, who will not blame me?” Tears streaming down, she continued, “Then why must you drag everyone into this? I fear I will be blamed if you persist.” Xue Pan’s anger mounted further, and he seized a door bolt, stormed off, and without further ado confronted Qiu Ling, accusing her bluntly. Qiu Ling cried out in protest. Aunt Xue rushed in and commanded, “Do not start beating her without knowing the full story! This maidservant has served for years—was there not a time when she made a mistake? Would you really do something so heartless? Ask clearly first, then act!” Hearing her words, Jin Gui feared that Xue Pan might soften, and she burst into tears, saying, “For half a month you have monopolized my Baochan, kept her from entering my room, and only allowed Qiu Ling to sleep with me. I wish to question Baochan, yet you continue protecting him. Now you act so defiantly as to beat her—if you kill me, then remarry as you please; why must you put on this farce?” Xue Pan’s anger grew even more. Aunt Xue, seeing how her daughter-in-law oppressed her son, cursed bitterly. In her fury she ordered, “Sell Xiangling immediately!” Miss Bao then laughed, “Our family only knows how to buy people, not sell them – madam, you are completely confused. If word gets out, won’t it be a laughingstock? If my elder brother and sister-in-law despise her and leave her to me, I am doomed!” Aunt Xue replied, “Better to dismiss her entirely than let her remain with us.” Miss Bao laughed, “Whether she stays with me or not is of no consequence – cut her off as if sold.” Xiangling had already run up to Aunt Xue, pleading bitterly and crying, unwilling to leave; she wished instead to remain with the young lady. Aunt Xue, with no alternative, had to relent. After that, Xiangling indeed left with Miss Bao, effectively severing her previous ties. Yet she could not help but feel sorrow under the moonlight and by lamplight she lamented softly. Although she had spent several years in Xue Pan’s household, her delicate condition—worsened by her inherited illness—meant she never bore children; now, further aggravated by anger and distress, her health declined, and she eventually developed a “dry blood” disorder, growing thinner and losing her appetite with no remedy proving effective. Meanwhile, Jin Gui continued to quarrel with Xue Pan. On occasion, bolstered by wine, he even confronted her twice. When he tried to strike with a stick, Jin Gui dodged and ordered him away. When he nearly drew a knife, she stretched out her neck defiantly. Unable to bring himself to hit her, Xue Pan raged for a while before giving up. In time this became habitual, and Jin Gui’s insults to Baochan grew ever more severe. Baochan, unable to match Xiangling, was like dry tinder; having bonded with Xue Pan over shared feelings, he completely disregarded Jin Gui. Angered by her continual mistreatment, Baochan refused to yield. At first there were verbal spats and shoving; later Jin Gui’s anger escalated to physical blows. Though Baochan dared not retaliate, he began to flail as if courting death – by day employing knives and scissors, by night resorting to ropes – causing endless tumult. Xue Pan, caught between loyalties he could not resolve, eventually stood helplessly by, thoroughly exasperated, and left the house in despair. Jin Gui, meanwhile, secretly explained to Baochan that that very night Xue Pan was to be “married” in Qiu Ling’s room – meaning she was to be forced to accompany him. At first Qiu Ling refused, but Jin Gui insisted that she must not be too particular about comfort in the dark hours. She scolded, “Have you not seen our master? He hoards his maidservants so that none can approach you – what is your plan?
As she wept silently, Feng’er arrived bearing clothes. Xiuyan looked at them and resolutely refused to accept them. Feng’er said, “The Mistress ordered me to bring you something; if you find these old garments unsuitable, please accept these new ones.” Xiuyan smiled and said, “I appreciate our Mistress’s kindness. But since I’ve already lost my old clothes, I dare not accept more. Please return them and convey my sincere thanks to our Mistress—I consider her kindness as already received.” She then pressed a small purse into Feng’er’s hand, and Feng’er had no choice but to accept and leave. Before long, Ping’er and Feng’er returned; Xiuyan greeted them warmly and they sat together for tea. Ping’er laughed, “Our Mistress says you are extraordinarily refined, Miss!” Xiuyan replied modestly, “I am merely indifferent.” Ping’er continued, “But our Mistress remarked, ‘If the girl does not accept these garments, it means she either finds them too old or looks down upon our Mistress.’ She said that when she offered them back, she wouldn’t accept them.” Xiuyan blushed and said, “Then I dare not refuse.” They exchanged tea and continued. At Madam Xue’s residence, turmoil reigned as Jin Gui’s antics had stirred the household. When the old woman returned and mentioned Xiuyan’s lost garment, both Baochai and her mother wept bitterly. Baochai lamented, “It is all because our brother is absent that Miss Xing must bear extra hardship. We are fortunate that Sister Feng is so capable; we must remain vigilant—after all, they are all our kin.” Just then, Xue Ke entered and declared, “Our elder brother, during his years abroad, has consorted with naught but scoundrels! Not one upright man among them—all are like a pack of foxes and dogs! I’ve already driven them out these past few days, and henceforth I forbid any such people from entering!” Madam Xue sighed, “Even though I have a son, it now feels as if I have none. Even if the authorities approve, he is a failure. You, my nephew, are wiser than your elder brother—I now place my hopes in you. Learn well from now on. Moreover, the daughter-in-law you have taken does not compare to what we had before. A girl’s marriage is never easy; if a husband is capable, then she will have a future. But if Miss Xing turns out to be like this…” She trailed off, gesturing inwardly, “I need not say more. Miss Xing indeed possesses both modest means and self-respect. Once our affairs are settled, and you complete your proper tasks, I too shall have one less worry.” Xue Ke replied, “Sister, the matter of the Qin-sister’s departure has been a great worry for the Mistress. As for that matter—what is there to be said?” They spoke idly for a while. Then Xue Ke returned to his room. After dinner, he recalled that Xiuyan—now residing in the Jia Garden—is a poor orphan forced to rely on others, barely managing her daily needs. Knowing her well from the day she arrived, with her appearance and character fully understood, he could only sigh over fate’s injustice: how is it that one like the affluent and pampered Xia Jingui is so fortunate, while Xiuyan must suffer? He mused bitterly on how the King of Hell might have judged them. Overwhelmed with melancholy, he attempted to compose a poem to vent his sorrow:    “Like a dragon deprived of water, a fish left to dry,   Two hearts, each in their separate lands, suffer in solitude. Together in the mire we endure endless hardships—   Who knows when we shall reach the realm of emptiness?”  Finishing his verse, he considered pasting it on the wall, but feeling too embarrassed to be ridiculed, he tucked it into his book instead. He then brooded on his advancing years and the calamities that had struck his family, lamenting that with every misfortune, the fragile state of his inner world became ever more desolate. At that moment, Baocan reappeared carrying a small box. With a cheerful smile, he set it on the table. Xue Ke invited him to sit. Baocan said, “These are four plates of assorted fruits and a small jug of wine—delivered by the Mistress for Second Master.” Xue Ke replied with a courteous smile, “The Mistress has truly been thoughtful.
Though she had spent several years in Xue Pan’s household, her delicate constitution – marred by her inherited illness – meant she never conceived; now, aggravated by anger and emotional strain, her health deteriorated further, and she gradually developed a “dry blood” syndrome, growing thinner and losing her appetite, with no effective remedy. Meanwhile, Jin Gui’s quarrels with Xue Pan grew more frequent. On some occasions, bolstered by wine, Xue Pan even confronted her twice. When he attempted to strike with a stick, Jin Gui dodged and ordered him away. When he nearly drew a knife to kill, she stretched out her neck in defiance. Xue Pan, unable to bring himself to hit her, raged for a while before giving up. Over time, this became habitual, and it even led Jin Gui to increasingly insult Baochan. Baochan, who could not compare with Xiangling, was like dry tinder; having bonded with Xue Pan over shared feelings, he completely disregarded Jin Gui. Outraged by Jin Gui’s continual mistreatment, Baochan refused to back down. At first there were quarrels and shoving; later Jin Gui’s anger escalated to insults, and then even to physical blows. Though Baochan dared not fight back, he began to roll and flail about as if seeking death, both by day with knives and scissors, and by night with ropes – causing endless havoc. Xue Pan, caught between conflicting loyalties, stood helplessly by, thoroughly exasperated, and eventually left the house in despair. Jin Gui, meanwhile, secretly explained to Baochan that that very night Xue Pan was to “marry” in Qiu Ling’s room – that is, she was to be made to accompany Jin Gui in bed. At first Qiu Ling refused, but Jin Gui insisted, claiming that she was being too fastidious and that comfort was secondary to convenience in the dark of night. She scolded, “Have you not seen our master? He takes every opportunity to hoard his maidservants and won’t let you near – what is your plan? I fear you intend to drive me to ruin!” Xue Pan, fearing that this might ruin Baochan’s reputation, quickly returned and admonished Qiu Ling, “If you do not obey, I will beat you!” Qiu Ling, with no choice, had to gather her bedding and lie down on the floor, reluctantly obeying. No sooner had she laid down than she was summoned repeatedly for tea throughout the night, and her legs were pounded several times so that she could not rest for a moment. Xue Pan, having secured Baochan as if it were a treasure, ignored all else. In his bitterness, Jin Gui murmured, “Let him have his fun for a few days; once he grows distant, then I can arrange for Xiangling. Then Baochan, originally mine, will be useless.” Quietly enduring, she schemed to further manipulate Qiu Ling. After about half a month, Qiu Ling suddenly pretended to be ill, complaining of unbearable heartache and immobility with treatments proving ineffective. Everyone remarked that it was due to her suppressed anger. After two days, unexpectedly, someone discovered a paper effigy hidden among Jin Gui’s pillows – bearing her age and an inscription of eight characters, with five needles pinned into her heart area and the gaps between her ribs and limbs. Thus the household took this as news and reported it first to Aunt Xue. Aunt Xue, now frantic, and Xue Pan, even more disordered, threatened to interrogate everyone. Jin Gui said, “There is no need to wrong innocent people. It appears that Baochan’s ‘demon-repelling charm’ must be used.” Xue Pan replied, “But she has not spent much time in your room lately; why cling to a good woman?” Jin Gui sneered, “Who else is there? Am I not the only one? Even if there were others, who would dare enter my room?” Xue Pan said, “Now that Qiu Ling follows you every day, she surely knows; question her and you will find out.” Jin Gui laughed coldly, “Question whom? Who will confess? In my view, they will all feign ignorance—so let it drop. Besides, even if I were to be punished to death, it matters little; I could always remarry someone better. Truly, if you complain, who will not blame me?” Bursting into tears, she continued, “Then why must you drag everyone into this? I fear I will be blamed if you persist.” Xue Pan’s anger mounted, and he snatched up a door bolt, stormed off, and without further ado confronted Qiu Ling, accusing her directly.
Observing his departure, Xue Ke surmised that whatever had transpired the previous night had been set in motion. He thought, “So be it; if they are angry enough, they may have completely made up their minds—and that spares me the trouble of further entanglement.” With his heart at last easing, he ordered someone to fetch water to wash his face and resolved to remain at home for a few days to recuperate, fearing that if he ventured out, someone might come looking for him. Meanwhile, those who had long been on friendly terms with Xue Pan—seeing that the Xue household was empty except for the young, inexperienced Xue Ke—began to covet his position. Some schemed to insert themselves as errand runners; others, capable of serving as assistants or scribes, hoped to manage his affairs; still others planned to extort money from him; and there were even those who spread menacing rumors. Xue Ke, noticing these intruders from afar, did his best to avoid them, though he dared not confront them directly for fear of provoking an unforeseen calamity. Instead, he hid within his home, awaiting further developments—a matter he did not elaborate on. That very night, Jin Gui had sent Baocan some wine and fruit to “probe” Xue Ke’s condition, and Baocan returned and recounted every detail of Xue Ke’s plight. When Jin Gui found that events were not proceeding entirely to his liking, he feared that the whole affair might backfire and that Baocan would look down on him; he tried to cover his tracks with a few evasive remarks but found himself at a loss. Distraught and seated in silent contemplation, Jin Gui had no clear plan until he resolved, at last, that perhaps the next morning he should go retrieve his belongings and, without even washing, change into one or two sets of delicately colored garments—thereby displaying a languid, unkempt charm that might provoke a reaction in Xue Ke. His thought was that if Xue Ke showed any sign of remorse, he would naturally withdraw, leaving Jin Gui’s scheme intact. When, at daybreak, Jin Gui encountered Xue Ke, who still appeared as he had the previous night—no trace of debauchery—Jin Gui pretended nothing was amiss. Instead, he returned with a dish, deliberately leaving behind the wine jug as a signal for further plotting. At that moment, Jin Gui asked, “When you went out, did anyone notice you?” Baocan replied, “No.” “Did Second Master question you?” Jin Gui continued. “Not at all,” Baocan answered. Jin Gui, having spent a sleepless night and still uncertain, mused, “If I were to set this plan in motion, how can Baocan possibly keep it hidden? Perhaps I should offer him a share so that he will have no objections. Moreover, since I cannot act on my own, I must rely on him to execute the plan. Let’s agree on a firm course of action.” With a wry smile, he then asked, “Tell me, what sort of man is our Second Master really?” Baocan shrugged and said, “He appears rather foolish.” Jin Gui laughed, “You speak as if you’ve had plenty of experience with men! No wonder our elder brother could never do without you at home.” Baocan only smirked and replied, “It is his failure to heed our Mistress’s wishes that I mention it.” “Explain how he has failed me,” demanded Jin Gui. Baocan said, “Our Mistress offers him the finest food, yet he refuses to eat—does that not betray her kindness?” He winked conspiratorially. “Don’t let your tongue run away with you,” Jin Gui chided. “I don’t understand your meaning.” Baocan laughed, “Oh, Mistress, worry not—I have only one heart to offer. But these matters must remain secret; if word gets out, it will all be ruined.” Jin Gui’s face flushed. “You little runt—you’re acting as if you’ve seduced countless men! No wonder our elder brother couldn’t live without you.” Baocan merely grinned and replied, “I serve our Mistress faithfully; as for our elder brother’s affairs, you know well what they are.” Thus, Jin Gui’s attempts to sow discord and manipulate the situation continued.
If Baoyu is truly as he is, we are in deep trouble.” Fengjie, after a moment’s thought, said, “It won’t be as bad as it seems. I have devised a plan—if our scheme does not work, then it will not matter. But if he shows any signs of interest, we’ll have to take extensive measures.” Madam Wang asked, “And what is this ‘switching’ plan you mention?” Fengjie replied, “Whether or not Baoyu understands our intentions, if everyone starts clamoring that the old master has decreed Lin Guniang as his bride, we can observe his reaction. If he pays no heed, then no switch is needed. But if he shows some affection, we’ll have to cover it up.” Madam Wang pressed, “Even if he does fancy her, what can you do?” Leaning close to Madam Wang, Fengjie whispered her scheme in detail. Madam Wang nodded and smiled, “Very well then.” Jia Mu inquired, “So what exactly have you two schemed?” Fengjie, fearing that Jia Mu might not understand, revealed the details in a low voice. Jia Mu, however, remained momentarily confused. Fengjie added a few more words, and Jia Mu finally smiled wryly, “It may work, but it will make poor Miss Bao suffer. If the ruckus breaks out, what then of Lin Guniang?” Fengjie answered, “This matter is to be told only to Baoyu—no one else shall hear a word.” At that moment a maid announced, “Second Master Lian has returned.” Madam Wang, fearing that Jia Mu might question him, exchanged a knowing glance with Fengjie. Fengjie went out to meet Jia Lian, pursing her lips as she joined Madam Wang in waiting. After a while, Madam Wang re-entered, her eyes red from weeping. Jia Lian offered his respects and then explained the situation at Shili Tun regarding the preparations for Prince Wang Teng’s funeral. He added, “I have received an imperial edict appointing our uncle to the Cabinet, with the title of Wenqin Duke; he has ordered that our family shall carry his casket back home, with palace officials escorting him along the way. Yesterday he departed, and the rest of the family has already returned south. Our maternal aunt sent word to inquire after us, saying ‘Who would have thought you could not enter the capital? There is so much unsaid—if my elder brother happens to meet you on the road, let him come and explain in detail.’” Hearing this, Madam Wang’s grief deepened. Fengjie consoled her, “Madam, please rest for a while; let us discuss Baoyu’s matter tonight.” After that, Fengjie returned with Jia Lian to her own room and discreetly told him to set aside any talk of the new bridal chamber. Later that day, after breakfast, Daiyu, accompanied by Zizhuan, went to see Jia Mu—both to pay her respects and to lift her spirits. As she left the Xiang Pavilion, she walked a few steps but suddenly recalled that she had forgotten her handkerchief. She sent Zizhuan back to fetch it while she ambled slowly, waiting. Just then, near Qinfang Bridge—by the very stone where Baoyu once lay flowers for the dead—she heard someone weeping softly. Daiyu paused and strained her ears but could not make out whose cry it was or what sorrowful words were being uttered. Curious, she approached slowly. There, she saw a maid with thick brows and large eyes weeping. At first, Daiyu suspected that one of the senior maids in the household might be venting her woes; but on closer look, she could not recognize the girl. The maid, noticing Daiyu’s approach, ceased her crying and wiped away her tears. Daiyu asked, “Why are you so heartbroken?” The maid, still crying, said, “Miss Lin, please judge the matter. When they speak, I don’t know what to say—I just uttered one wrong word, and my elder sister beat me!” Daiyu, not quite understanding, asked, “Who is your elder sister?” The maid replied, “It’s Sister Zhenzhu.” Only then did Daiyu realize that the maid belonged to Jia Mu’s household.
Why are you skulking about?” asked Jia Mu. Taking the opportunity, Madam Wang recounted to Jia Mu everything she had heard about Baoyu’s troubled state. For a long while, Jia Mu said nothing; both Madam Wang and Fengjie fell silent. Finally, Jia Mu sighed, “All matters can be discussed—but Lin Guniang, at least, poses no threat. If Baoyu is truly as he is, we are in deep trouble.” Fengjie, after a moment’s thought, said, “It won’t be as bad as it seems. I have devised a plan—if our scheme does not work, then it will not matter. But if he shows any signs of interest, we’ll have to take extensive measures.” Madam Wang asked, “And what is this ‘switching’ plan you mention?” Fengjie replied, “Whether or not Baoyu understands our intentions, if everyone starts clamoring that the old master has decreed Lin Guniang as his bride, we can observe his reaction.

Fengjie went out to meet Jia Lian, pursing her lips as she joined Madam Wang in waiting. After a while, Madam Wang re-entered, her eyes red from weeping. Jia Lian offered his respects and then explained the situation at Shili Tun regarding the preparations for Prince Wang Teng’s funeral.

The maid, noticing Daiyu’s approach, ceased her crying and wiped away her tears. Daiyu asked, “Why are you so heartbroken?” The maid, still crying, said, “Miss Lin, please judge the matter.
Surely even the Mistress and our elder sister understand.” Baocan protested, “I dare not refuse our Mistress’s orders. Our Mistress’s temperament, as you well know, is not to be trifled with. If I return it, it might be said I have not done my duty.” Xue Ke, feeling somewhat troubled, had no choice but to leave the wine with him. As Baocan prepared to leave, he peeked outside and then turned back with a smile, “Soon enough, you’ll be called upon in person to express your gratitude.” Xue Ke, uncertain of his meaning, flushed and said, “Please convey my thanks to the Mistress. It is cold, and besides, you and your kin need not trouble yourselves with such trivialities.” Baocan said nothing further, smiling as he departed. Xue Ke initially suspected that Jin Gui’s involvement in Xue Pan’s matter might have been a ruse for the Mistress to send wine and fruit to appease him. But when he observed Baocan’s furtive and uneasy manner, he began to wonder. “Could it be,” he mused, “that since Baocan is from our Mistress’s household, he has his own considerations? Perhaps he is too timid to speak plainly and uses Jin Gui’s name to divert attention. Or maybe, being a member of our brother’s household, there is more to the matter than meets the eye…” Suddenly, another thought struck him: “Jin Gui, who has never observed proper family decorum—and who sometimes, in a fit of gaiety, dresses in outrageously coquettish attire, convinced of his own beauty—might harbor ill intentions. Could it be that he and our Qin-sister have been involved in some improper affair, and have thus contrived this ploy to drag my name through the mud? Who can say?” The thought sent a shiver down his spine. Lost in these troubled musings, he suddenly heard a muffled laugh from outside—a sound that startled him greatly. Who uttered it remains to be revealed in the next installment. Chapter 93: As Baocan Schemes Amid Licentious Designs, While Baoyu Foolishly Ruminates on Zen  It happened that while Xue Ke was still deep in his anxious thoughts, he suddenly heard a laugh outside his window. Startled, he thought, “It can’t be Baocan—it must be Jin Gui.” Yet, he resolved not to pay them any further heed, waiting to see what trick they might play. For a long while he strained his ears, but there was only silence. Unwilling to even partake of the wine and fruit, he shut his door. Just as he was about to undress, he heard a slight rustle on the window paper. Already having been toyed with by Baocan the previous night, Xue Ke’s heart pounded with confusion and uncertainty. Listening intently to the faint sound, he looked closely, but found no movement—only then did suspicion seize him. He sank onto a chair by the lamp, turning over a piece of fruit in his hand as he pondered. Suddenly, he glanced back and discovered that a portion of the paper on the window was damp. Approaching it to inspect, a cold gust blew from outside accompanied by a series of creaking, laughing sounds that startled him greatly. In his fright, Xue Ke quickly blew out the lamp and lay perfectly still, holding his breath. From outside, a voice cried, “Second Master, why do you not drink your wine and eat your fruit before going to sleep?” The tone unmistakably echoed Baocan’s. Xue Ke, feigning sleep, remained silent. A couple more remarks followed—one, in a tone of bitter reproach, exclaimed, “What man in all the world is so hapless?” The words seemed to be uttered partly by Baocan and partly by Jin Gui, and Xue Ke understood their meaning at last. He tossed and turned in his thoughts until he finally managed to sleep after the fifth watch. At dawn, someone knocked at his door. Xue Ke called out, “Who is it?” but received no answer. Reluctantly, he rose and opened the door to find Baocan standing there, his hair disheveled and his arms wrapped around himself. He was dressed in a tight-fitting jacket with gold-trimmed pipa-style collar, secured by a half-new, pine-green sweatband; below, he wore no skirt at all, revealing stone-pomegranate–red embroidered breeches and a pair of newly embroidered red shoes.
Returning inside, Tan-chun found that Xiang-yun was holding Dai-yu’s hand while Dai-yu wept uncontrollably, with Ziyuan cradling her and gently massaging her chest until her eyes gradually cleared. Tan-chun smiled and said, “I guess you’ve grown suspicious from the old maid’s words?” Dai-yu shook her head. Tan-chun continued, “They were only cursing their own granddaughter—and I heard it clearly. These sorts of insults have no reason or propriety; they never observe any taboos. How could a daughter of a wealthy family, orphaned as you are, be treated so contemptuously by someone who must have been sent by someone else? Who would dare to let such abuse happen?” Overwhelmed, Dai-yu burst into further tears. Ziyuan urged, “Tell me—what exactly is troubling you? Please wake up!”  Tan-chun consoled her, “Don’t be upset. I have come for you as your sister should. You’re so isolated now; if you take your medicine and fill your heart with pleasant thoughts, you can slowly regain your strength. We sisters still gather for poetry societies—would that not be delightful?”  Xiang-yun interjected, “But didn’t Third Sister say that you’re in no mood to be cheerful?”  Dai-yu, choking back tears, replied, “How can I be cheerful when I have no strength to face another day? I fear I simply cannot bear it.”  Tan-chun gently said, “Now, rest for a while. When you need anything, just have Ziyuan call for me.”  With that, Dai-yu tearfully told them, “Please, when you go to Grandmother’s place, only tell her I send my respects and that I’m a bit unwell—nothing serious that should worry her.”  Tan-chun promised, “I understand. Just focus on resting.” Then she and Xiang-yun left together. Meanwhile, Ziyuan helped Dai-yu lie down on her bed. The household staff took care of the other matters while Ziyuan remained by Dai-yu’s side. Though her heart ached, Dai-yu could not bring herself to cry openly. As she lay there with her eyes closed, the usual ambient sounds of the garden—the wind, the insects’ chirrups, the birds’ calls, and even distant footsteps—suddenly seemed to mingle with the cries of children, creating a dissonant clamor that grated on her already troubled soul. “Unfold the curtains,” she called softly to Ziyuan. Soon Snow-Quill (Xue-Yan) brought a bowl of bird’s-nest soup and handed it to Ziyuan. Peering through the curtain, Ziyuan gently asked, “Would you have a sip, dear?” Dai-yu murmured a faint “yes.” Ziyuan then offered the bowl to Snow-Quill, but after taking a couple of sips, Dai-yu shook her head and refused. Still, Ziyuan gently helped her settle back to sleep. After a while, hushed voices were heard outside, someone whispering, “Is Ziyuan at home?”  Snow-Quill quietly went out and, seeing Xiren, whispered that “the young miss is in her room.” Xiren then cautiously asked, “What’s the matter, dear?” as she went to investigate, recounting what had transpired during the night. Xiren’s words startled everyone, and she commented, “Can you imagine? Last night, someone’s cry of pain nearly frightened Second Master half to death!” At that, they all exchanged worried glances. Suddenly, they heard another cough from within Dai-yu’s room. Ziyuan hurried over with the phlegm-collector. Dai-yu, barely opening her eyes, asked, “Who were you speaking with?”  Ziyuan explained, “Xiren came to check on you.”  Before long, Xiren arrived at Dai-yu’s bedside. Dai-yu ordered Ziyuan to help her sit up and gestured for Xiren to sit by her side. Xiren sat and gently urged, “Dear, please rest a bit more.”  Dai-yu, trying to mask her distress, said, “Don’t mention it.
Hand it over so I can see.” Mèiyuè went off to fetch it from some documents in the inner room. Baoyu took it and saw that on the cover it read, “Greetings from Uncle.” Baoyu said, “Why does this child no longer acknowledge me as his father?” Xiren asked, “What do you mean?” Baoyu replied, “The year before last when he sent me a white begonia, he addressed me as ‘Father’; but today the envelope cover says ‘Uncle’—has he now disowned me?” Xiren said, “He’s shameless, and so are you—though he’s grown up, to call you such a term shows his impudence. You’re supposed to be a proper…” Just then, as she spoke, her face reddened and she gave a slight smile. Baoyu, realizing the implication, said, “It’s hard to say—the common saying goes: ‘Among monks, many are filial sons.’ I suppose he’s simply clever and knows how to win hearts. If he doesn’t want to acknowledge me, I wouldn’t mind.” As he spoke, he began to tear open the note. Xiren laughed and said, “That little Yun is always so mischievous—always wanting to be noticed one moment and then hiding the next; it’s clear he has dubious intentions.” Baoyu was absorbed in reading the characters on the note and paid no heed to Xiren’s remarks. When Xiren saw him frowning, she smiled gently and shook her head. Eventually, growing rather impatient, she asked, “What does it say?” But Baoyu did not answer; he had already torn the note into several pieces. Seeing this, Xiren thought it best not to press further and asked, “After eating, why don’t you read a bit?” Baoyu said, “That silly Yun! What a scoundrel—messing about like this!” Noticing that his answer was off-topic, Xiren smiled mildly and inquired, “What exactly is going on?” Baoyu replied, “I asked him, ‘What are you doing?’ Let’s eat and then rest. My mind is in such a tizzy.” With that, he called for a little maid to light a fire and burned the torn pieces of the note. Soon, the little maids brought the meal, but Baoyu sat there in a daze. Xiren, both coaxing and chiding him, urged him to eat a bite before setting the food aside; yet he remained dejectedly slumped on his bed. Before long, tears suddenly welled up in him. At that moment, both Xiren and Mèiyuè were at a loss. Mèiyuè said, “What’s this about? What’s with all this talk of ‘Yun’ and ‘Yu’—it seems something has happened, leaving him acting so foolishly, crying one moment and laughing the next. If this drags on, how can anyone bear it?” As she spoke, she became genuinely distressed. Xiren, unable to help but smile, urged, “Oh, dear sister, don’t take it out on others. He can handle it on his own—what’s written on his note, is it really related to you?” Mèiyuè retorted, “Don’t lump everything together. Do you know what sort of nonsense is written on that note? Don’t twist it to suit your own case. If anything, it might even pertain to you!” Before Xiren could reply, Baoyu suddenly burst into laughter from his bed, jumped up, shook his clothes, and said, “Let’s go to sleep; enough of this fuss. Tomorrow I must get up early to study.” With that, he lay back down, and the night passed in silence. The next day, after Baoyu got up and groomed himself, he went off to the family school. Stepping out of the courtyard, he suddenly remembered and called out to Bei Ming and the others, “Where is Sister Mèiyuè?” Mèiyuè, coming out, asked, “Why have you returned?” Baoyu said, “Today Yun is coming; tell him not to cause a ruckus here. If he does, I’ll have to report back to Grandmother and Grandfather.” Mèiyuè assented, and Baoyu turned to leave.
Listening to Yuanyang, he seems to fall for every pretty face. Isn’t it that we girls have all been fretting in vain?”  Zizhuan had originally been thinking of Daiyu, but soon found herself at a loss as to whom to favor, her mind clouded with infatuation. She wished she could tell Daiyu not to worry, yet feared that might only add to her distress; seeing Daiyu like this was indeed pitiful. After much vacillation, she became agitated and scolded herself, “Why do you waste your worry on others? Even if Lin Miss truly is made for Baoyu, his temperament is hard to restrain. Though Baoyu is of a gentle nature, he tends to bite off more than he can chew. I advise that we need not fuss over it—my own worry is enough. From now on, I’ll devote myself entirely to serving our girl, and let everything else go.” With that thought, she felt a sense of relief. Returning to the Xiaoxiang Pavilion, she found Daiyu sitting alone on the kang, revising her old manuscripts of poems and essays. Lifting her head as she saw Zizhuan enter, Daiyu asked, “Where have you been?”  Zizhuan replied, “Today I visited the other sisters.”  “Were you looking for Sister Xiren?” Daiyu inquired. Zizhuan said, “Why should I look for her?”  For a moment, Daiyu wondered, “How did that slip out so easily?” Feeling somewhat embarrassed, she retorted, “Whether you look or not is none of your concern! Go serve some tea.”  Zizhuan silently chuckled and went off to fetch tea. Suddenly, a clamor arose in the garden, the source unknown. While serving tea, Zizhuan sent someone to investigate. The messenger soon reported: “In the Yihong Courtyard, several of the Haitang trees had withered from neglect, with no one attending to them. Yesterday, Baoyu went to have a look and noticed what seemed to be a bud on one of the branches, but no one paid any heed. Then, today, the Haitang flower bloomed splendidly, astonishing everyone—they all rushed to see it. Even the old lady and Madam were excited and came to view the flower. That is why the Grand Madam ordered for the leaves in the garden to be cleared, and these people are now being summoned there.”  Daiyu, having heard this and knowing that the old lady was coming, changed her clothes and sent Xueyan to ask, “If the old lady arrives, come and tell me immediately.” Not long after, Xueyan hurried back saying, “The old lady and Madam have gathered quite a few people. Please go now, girl.”  Daiyu quickly glanced at herself in the mirror, brushed back her side hair, and, leaning on Zizhuan, went to the Yihong Courtyard. There she saw the old lady sitting on the divan where Baoyu usually reclined. Daiyu immediately said, “Please greet the old lady.” Stepping back, she then encountered the Second Wife of Prince Xing; after that, she met Li Wan, Tan Chun, Xi Chun, and Xing Xiuyan, exchanging pleasantries. Only Feng Jie was absent due to illness; Shi Xiangyun had returned to the capital with her uncle on a transfer; Xue Baoqin was staying with her elder sister; and the Li sisters, because of the tumult in the garden, had been sent out by Aunt Li to reside elsewhere. So, today, Daiyu saw only a few people. After a short while of laughter and conversation about the strangely blooming flower, Jia Mu said, “These flowers normally bloom in March. Though it is now November, owing to the delayed season—more like October in a mild ‘little spring’—with warm weather, the flowers can indeed bloom.”  Madam Wang added, “The old lady has seen many, so she’s not surprised.”  Lady Xing remarked, “I heard that these flowers had withered for an entire year. Why should they bloom now, out of season? There must be an underlying reason.”  Li Wan laughed, “The old lady and Madam are both saying the same thing. In my muddled thinking, it must be that Baoyu has some joyous event forthcoming, and this flower is the harbinger of good news.”  Though Tan Chun said nothing, inwardly she mused, “It must not be an auspicious sign.
Who says you and I are strangers?”  Jia Yun replied, “Understood.” With that, he departed through the gate. Xiao Hong stood watching him until he was well out of sight, then returned inside. Inside, Sister Feng was busy instructing preparations for the evening meal. She then asked, “Have you prepared the porridge yet?”  The maidservants hurried to check and returned, “It is ready.”  Sister Feng said, “Now bring a couple of plates of those poor-quality southern pickles.”  Qiu Tong agreed and called the maids to attend. Meanwhile, Ping’er came in laughing, “I almost forgot—this afternoon, when the old lady was at Grandmother’s, the master of Shuiyue An sent someone to ask for two bottles of southern side dishes, plus to requisition a few months’ allowance, saying that he was not satisfied with what he had. I asked that Taoist nun, ‘Why isn’t the master satisfied?’ She said, ‘It’s been four or five days. Last night, because some of the young acolytes and novice monks—some of the girls—refused to blow out the lamps before sleep, he repeatedly told them to do so. That night, even after three midnight hours the lamps were still lit. He ordered them to extinguish the lights himself; but though he did so, no one responded. He then got up himself and put them out. When he returned to his bed, he saw a man and a woman sitting there. He rushed over to ask who they were, only to find that a rope had been looped around his neck. He immediately called for help. The others, upon hearing this, lit lamps and came running, only to find that they had both collapsed on the bed, foaming at the mouth. Fortunately, they were revived. At that time, he could not eat anything, so he sent for some small side dishes.” I explained to the old lady that since she was not in the room, I couldn’t intervene, so I told him, “The old lady isn’t available right now; when she returns, she will be informed.” And I sent him on his way. Just then, when I heard mention of the southern dishes, I remembered them—lest we forget.”  Sister Feng paused in astonishment and said, “The southern side dishes are still available—have someone send them over. As for the silver, wait until Brother Qin comes tomorrow to collect it.”  Then Xiao Hong entered and announced, “Just now Second Master sent word that he has urgent business outside the city tonight and cannot return—please notify everyone accordingly.”  Sister Feng replied, “That’s right.”  While they were talking, a little maid came panting from the back, running into the courtyard. Outside, Ping’er and several other maidservants were chattering nervously. Sister Feng asked, “What are you all saying?”  Ping’er replied, “One of the little maids, trembling with fear, said she heard voices like a clamor coming from three empty rooms in the back—like the sound of cats or mice or even someone venting anger. She got so frightened that she ran back.”  Sister Feng scolded, “Nonsense! I won’t have you spreading ghost stories. I never believe such superstitions—now get out of here!”  The little maid scurried away. Sister Feng then called Cai Ming to go over the daily miscellaneous accounts. It was already nearly the second watch of the night. After a brief rest and some idle chatter, everyone was told to retire. Sister Feng herself then went to sleep. Approaching the third watch, Sister Feng seemed unable to sleep. Feeling a sudden chill running down her spine, she awoke more and more agitated. She called Ping’er and Qiu Tong to keep her company. The two were puzzled by her mood. Originally, Qiu Tong had not been on good terms with Sister Feng, but after Jia Lian’s affair with You Er (the Second Sister) diminished his favor for Qiu Tong, and Sister Feng began to court him, Qiu Tong had grown quieter—though her heart remained more troubled than Ping’er’s. Seeing that Sister Feng was distraught, Qiu Tong brought some tea. Sister Feng sipped it and said, “Thank you, but go back to sleep; it is enough if Ping’er stays here.”  Qiu Tong, wishing to be of service, said, “If the old lady can’t sleep, perhaps the two of us should take turns keeping watch.” Sister Feng murmured a few words and then fell asleep.
Later that night, while the maids in the Yihong Courtyard are preparing to disperse for the night, a commotion arises at the courtyard door. Suddenly, an elderly maid opens it to find that a young maid—named Little Que from Zhao Yiniang’s room—has come inside looking for Baoyu. At this time Baoyu has just fallen asleep, with Qingwen and others still sitting by the bed joking. When they see Little Que, they ask, “What is it? Why have you come at this hour?”  In a hushed tone, Little Que tells Baoyu: “I came to bring you a message. Earlier, our nanny was prattling in front of the Master, and I only heard the name ‘Baoyu’ mentioned. I thought you should know—listen carefully tomorrow when the Master speaks with you.”  After saying this, she turns and leaves. Xiren orders that she be kept to drink tea (fearing that if the door is closed she might be trapped), and Little Que is sent off. Baoyu, upon hearing this, realizes that Zhao Yiniang’s intentions are as deceitful as those of his foes. Not understanding what exactly was said, he feels a sudden, unsettling tightness in his limbs and all over his body—as if the magical headband of Sun Wukong had been tightened. After musing over his predicament and lamenting that he had not been diligent in his studies (“I ought to have reviewed my texts every day!”), he resigns himself to his limited repertoire—only being able to recite a few portions of “Xue,” “Yong,” and parts of the “Lun,” while much of the “Mengzi” and the “Five Classics” remain half-memorized. Even the ancient texts and historical writings he once studied have faded into vague recollections, and his knowledge of the eight-legged essay remains unsatisfactory. As a result, his anxiety grows, for if he must review one text he fears he might neglect another, and he finds it impossible to properly rehearse them all in one night. His efforts to study not only prove fruitless but also disturb the entire household of maids—preventing them from getting any sleep. While Xiren and others trim candles and serve tea, the little maids grow drowsy, slumping about. Qingwen scolds them: “What clumsy little brats you are! All day you loll about like lifeless corpses. If you oversleep even a little, you start putting on airs—if you continue, I’ll have to prick you with a needle!” Barely finished speaking, they suddenly hear a thud from outside. Rushing to look, they find a young maid who had been tapping her wrist has accidentally bumped her head against a wall, jolting her from sleep. At that very moment, as Qingwen finishes her threat, the maid, mistaking the situation as if Qingwen had struck her, bursts into tears and pleads, “Oh, dear sister, I won’t dare again!” Everyone laughs. Baoyu quickly intercedes, “Leave her be. She should simply be allowed to sleep. You all should take turns sleeping as well.” Xiren chides, “Little Master, just mind your own business! For tonight, devote your heart to these few books—once we get through this, you can resume your other tasks. It won’t harm anything.” Baoyu, moved by her earnest tone, reads a few more lines from his book. Miaoyue pours a cup of tea to soothe his throat, which Baoyu accepts. Noticing that Miaoyue is wearing only a short jacket, Baoyu remarks, “It’s so chilly now—shouldn’t you wear a proper coat?” Miaoyue laughs and gestures toward her book, “Forget about us for now; let your mind focus on your studies.”  Before long, Spring Yan and Qiu Wen burst in from the back room, shouting, “It’s terrible! Someone just jumped off the wall!” The crowd rushes to ask, “Where?” and everyone scurries off to search. Qingwen, noticing Baoyu’s distressed expression as he studies with a pained look, resolves to come up with a solution to help him overcome his anxiety. Suddenly, she suggests, “Seize this chance—feign illness and say you were startled!” Her suggestion strikes a chord in Baoyu’s heart.
Unable to come herself, she has sent a servant to attend to both the old lady and Madam. Also, two pieces of red cloth have been given as a congratulatory gift to Second Master Bao, to accompany these flowers.”  Xiren came over to receive the gift and presented it to Jia Mu, who laughed, “It seems that even Feng’s maid, though ill, has managed to cause some commotion—how dignified, fresh, and amusing.” Xiren, laughing, said to Ping’er, “Go back and thank Second Madam on behalf of Second Master Bao. If there is joy, we should all share it.”  Jia Mu, laughing, said, “Ah! I almost forgot. Though Feng’s maid is ill, she still thinks of us, and her gift is quite clever indeed.” As she spoke, everyone left together. Privately, Ping’er told Xiren, “Granny said that this strange blooming of the flower calls for you to cut a piece of red silk and hang it up—this must be connected with the joyful event. From now on, we needn’t talk of it merely as an oddity.” Xiren nodded in agreement and sent Ping’er away without further mention. Now, it happened that Baoyu had been resting at home in a round leather jacket. When he saw the flower in bloom, he went out to have a look, to admire it, to sigh over it, and to express his fondness—his myriad emotions of joy and sorrow, love and separation, all became linked with this very flower. Suddenly, hearing that Jia Mu was about to arrive, he hurriedly changed into a fox-fur sleeved jacket and donned a dark fox-leg surcoat. In his haste, he neglected to fasten the “Tongling Treasure Jade” around his neck. Later, after Jia Mu had departed, he changed again. Xiren noticed that the jade was missing from around Baoyu’s neck and asked, “Where is that piece of jade?”  Baoyu replied, “In the confusion while changing, I took it off and placed it on the kang table—I did not bring it with me.”  Xiren looked around the table but found no jade. She then searched everywhere; its trace was completely gone, and she was struck with cold sweat. Baoyu said, “Don’t worry—it must be somewhere in the house. Just ask around and you’ll know.”  Thinking that they might be playing a trick on him, Xiren smiled and said to the others, “Little ones, are you playing? Where have you hidden this thing? Don’t really lose it—if it goes missing, we’ll all be in deep trouble!”  Mesha and the others, speaking in serious tones, replied, “What are you saying? Play is play, but this matter is no joke. Don’t mix things up. Have you lost your mind? Think—where could it have been placed? Now you’re blaming others!”  Seeing that their expressions were not lighthearted at all, Xiren grew anxious and pleaded, “Heavens, little ancestor! Where on earth did you leave it?”  Baoyu said, “I clearly remember placing it on the kang table. Where exactly are you looking?”  Xiren, Mesha, and the others dared not alert anyone and secretly searched every nook and cranny. After much commotion all day, without any result—even after overturning boxes and chests—they suspected that perhaps one of those people who came in earlier might have taken it away for inspection. Xiren said, “Everyone knows that this jade is as dear as one’s life. Who would dare to tamper with it! For now, keep quiet and search everywhere. If any of the sisters turns out to have taken it to tease us, they must kowtow to get it back; and if any little maid has stolen it, once questioned, she must not be brought before the elders. No matter what compensation is offered to exchange it back, it must be acceptable. This is not a trivial matter—if we truly lose it, it will be even worse than losing Second Master Bao’s favor!”  Just as Mesha and Qiu Wen were about to head out, Xiren hurriedly cautioned, “Those who are dining here, do not begin questioning them first. If we can’t find it, causing further turmoil would be all the worse.” Mesha and the others, following her instructions, split up to search.
Now you act so defiantly as to beat her—if you kill me, then remarry as you please; why must you put on this farce?” Xue Pan’s anger grew even more. Aunt Xue, seeing how her daughter-in-law oppressed her son, cursed bitterly. In her fury she ordered, “Sell Xiangling immediately!” Miss Bao then laughed, “Our family only knows how to buy people, not sell them—madam, you are completely confused. If word gets out, won’t it be a laughingstock? If my elder brother and sister-in-law despise her and leave her to me, I’m doomed!” Aunt Xue replied, “Better to dismiss her entirely than allow her to remain with us.” Miss Bao laughed, “Whether she stays with me or not is immaterial—cut her off as if she were sold.” Xiangling had already run up to Aunt Xue, pleading bitterly and crying, unwilling to leave; she wished instead to remain with the young lady. Aunt Xue, with no alternative, had to relent. Thereafter, Xiangling left with Miss Bao, effectively severing her ties with the past. Yet she could not help but feel sorrow beneath the moonlight, and by lamplight she quietly lamented. Although she had spent several years in Xue Pan’s household, her delicate condition – worsened by her inherent illness – meant she never bore children; now, further aggravated by anger and distress, her health declined, and she eventually developed a “dry blood” disorder, growing thinner and losing her appetite with no remedy proving effective. Meanwhile, Jin Gui continued to quarrel with Xue Pan. On occasion, emboldened by wine, he confronted her twice. When he tried to strike with a stick, Jin Gui dodged and ordered him away. When he nearly drew a knife, she stretched out her neck defiantly. Unable to bring himself to hit her, Xue Pan raged for a while before giving up. In time, this became habitual, and Jin Gui’s insults to Baochan grew ever more severe. Baochan, who could not compare with Xiangling, was like dry tinder; having bonded with Xue Pan through shared sentiments, he completely disregarded Jin Gui. Outraged by her continual mistreatment, Baochan refused to relent. At first there were verbal spats and shoving; later Jin Gui’s anger escalated to physical blows. Though Baochan dared not retaliate, he began to thrash about as if courting death – by day with knives and scissors, by night with ropes – causing endless commotion. Xue Pan, caught between loyalties he could not resolve, eventually stood helplessly by, thoroughly exasperated, and left the house in despair. Jin Gui, meanwhile, secretly explained to Baochan that that very night Xue Pan was to be “married” in Qiu Ling’s room – meaning she was to be forced to accompany him in bed. At first Qiu Ling refused, but Jin Gui insisted that she must not be overly particular about comfort in the dark hours. She scolded, “Have you not seen our master? He clutches his maidservants so tightly that none may approach you – what is your plan? I fear you intend to drive me to ruin!” Worried that this might ruin Baochan’s reputation, Xue Pan quickly returned and admonished Qiu Ling, “If you do not obey, I will beat you!” With no alternative, Qiu Ling had to gather her bedding and lie down on the floor, reluctantly obeying. No sooner had she settled than she was repeatedly summoned for tea throughout the night, and her legs were struck several times so that she could not rest a moment. Xue Pan, having secured Baochan as if he were a treasure, ignored all else. In his bitterness, Jin Gui murmured, “Let him have his fun for a few days; when he grows distant, then I can arrange Xiangling as I wish. Then Baochan, originally mine, will be of no consequence.” Quietly enduring, she schemed to further control Qiu Ling. After about half a month, Qiu Ling suddenly feigned illness, complaining of unbearable heartache and immobility with treatments proving ineffective. Everyone remarked that it was due to her suppressed anger. After two days, unexpectedly, someone discovered a paper effigy hidden among Jin Gui’s pillows – bearing her age and an inscription of eight characters, with five needles pinned into her heart area and the gaps between her ribs and limbs. Thus the household took it as news and reported it first to Aunt Xue.
Miaoyu rose swiftly and hurried away. Baoyu asked, “What happened?” Miaoyu replied, “You will know in time; there’s no need to say more.” And with that, she left, leaving Baoyu full of doubts and dejection. He returned to the Yi Hong Courtyard in a gloomy state—his heart heavy and his spirit subdued. Meanwhile, Miaoyu had already reached her quarters. A Taoist nun met her at the gate, closed the door of the hermitage, and after a while recited the “Daily Chants of the Zen Gate.” After dinner, she lit incense, paid homage to the Buddha, and told the nun to rest. Her meditation mat and screen were already neatly arranged; she drew a long breath, lowered the curtain, and sat cross-legged, striving to cut off all delusions as she reached toward true Being. Around the third watch of the night, she was startled by a loud clamor on the upper floor. Fearing intruders, Miaoyu rose from her meditation and went out into the veranda. There, she saw shifting shadows across the sky and the pale glow of the moon like flowing water. Although the weather was not terribly cold, she stood alone at the balustrade for a long while. Suddenly, she heard two cats outside meowing and hissing at one another. At that moment, Miaoyu recalled Baoyu’s words earlier in the day, and her heart began to race, her ears burning with heat. She quickly composed herself and retreated to her inner room, returning to her meditation seat. Yet her mind would not settle; it raced like a stampede of horses, and she felt as if her body were no longer rooted in the hermitage. In her delirium, visions of many noble youths came to court her, while matchmakers jostled and pulled her onto a carriage; then, bandits appeared brandishing knives and clubs, forcing her to cry out for help. The sudden chaos woke the Taoist nun and other attendant nuns, who rushed in with torches to check on her. They found Miaoyu’s hands flung wide, frothing at the mouth. As they roused her, her eyes were wide open, her cheeks flushed bright red, and she shouted, “I am protected by the Buddha! How dare you ruffians threaten me?” The attendants, utterly confused, urged, “We are here—please calm down and wake!” Miaoyu insisted, “I must return home! If there is any honest soul, send me back immediately.” The nun replied, “This is your residence,” and called for other nuns to hastily pray before the Guanyin statue. They drew lots, and upon reading the lot, found that she had offended a malevolent spirit in the southwest corner. One said, “Indeed, in the southwest corner of the Grand View Garden no one resides—yet the sinister qi remains.” Meanwhile, the nuns scrambled about with water and soup. One of the nuns, who had accompanied Miaoyu from the south, devoted herself to serving her faithfully, seating herself around Miaoyu’s meditation mat. Miaoyu looked up and asked, “Who are you?” The nun replied, “It is I.” Miaoyu examined her closely and said, “Ah, it is you!” Overcome, she embraced the nun and wept, “You are like a mother to me—if you do not save me, I cannot live!” The nun called for help and gently massaged her, while the Taoist nun poured her some tea. Only at dawn did Miaoyu fall asleep. The nun then sent someone to fetch a physician. Some said her condition was due to spleen injury from overthinking, others attributed it to heat in the blood, or to an invasion of evil spirits, while still others believed it was simply an external cold; ultimately, no consensus was reached. Finally, a doctor arrived, asked, “Have you been meditating?” The Taoist nun answered, “Yes, she has meditated regularly.” The doctor inquired, “Did this ailment come on suddenly last night?” The nun confirmed, “Indeed.” The doctor explained, “This is the result of the demon within stirring up fire.” When asked if it was serious, he replied, “Fortunately, her meditation was short, and the demon’s influence was shallow—there is hope for recovery.” He prescribed medicine to subdue the inner fire, and after one dose, her condition slightly improved. Outside, rumors began to circulate among the wandering idlers: “At such an age, how can one endure this?
All the sisters and Baoyu crowded around to read it, and they interpreted its meaning as: “Though you search for it now, it cannot be found; yet once lost, it shall not remain so forever. But where is Qinggeng Peak?” Li Wan mused, “This is an immortal riddle. How could a Qinggeng Peak ever emerge within our household? It must be that someone, fearful of being discovered, has hidden it beneath a stone where a pine grows. Yet the line ‘enter my door’—whose door is meant here?” Daiyu asked, “I wonder, whose immortal are we summoning?” Xiuyan answered, “The Wayward Immortal.” Tan Chun remarked, “If it is an immortal’s door, then it is hard to enter.” Xiren, anxious, began to search high and low—peeking under every stone—but to no avail. Returning to the courtyard, Baoyu made no further inquiry but only smiled foolishly. Mesha fretted, “Little ancestor, exactly where did you lose it? Explain yourself! Otherwise, we will all be punished, and our disgrace will be out in the open.” Baoyu laughed, “I said it was lost out there; yet you all refuse to believe me. Now you ask me—how could I possibly know?” Li Wan and Tan Chun said, “It’s already past the second watch of the night. Look—Miss Lin has lost her composure and gone her own way. We should rest; let the matter be discussed again tomorrow.” With that, the crowd dispersed. Baoyu soon retired for the night, still smiling in his foolish way. Poor Xiren and the others wept and pondered, lying awake the whole night—no detail is worth recounting here. Meanwhile, Daiyu returned to her room and recalled the old tales about “gold” and “jade.” This filled her with a secret delight as she mused, “The words of monks and priests are hardly to be trusted. If indeed ‘gold’ and ‘jade’ are fated, how could Baoyu possibly lose this jade? Or perhaps it is because of me that their destined union is being undone…” Lost in thought for a long while, she felt strangely at ease and dismissed the day’s weariness, resuming her reading. Zizhuan, feeling drowsy, urged Daiyu to sleep. Yet as Daiyu lay down, her thoughts drifted to the Haitang flower. “This jade was born with me—it is no ordinary object, and its comings and goings are fated. If this flower is to herald good fortune, surely the jade should not be lost. Perhaps this unusual blooming portends misfortune—could it be that something ominous is about to occur?” she murmured, and her heart grew heavy. In her alternating moods of sorrow and joy, she finally dozed off around the fifth watch. The next day, Madam Wang and the others sent people early to the pawnshops to inquire, and Fengjie secretly sought it as well. For several days, the matter was all the rage, yet the jade remained unfound. Neither Jia Mu nor Jia Zheng knew the news. Each day, Xiren and the others lived in constant anxiety. Baoyu himself stayed away from his studies for days on end—he was distant, silent, and listless. Madam Wang knew only that his condition had worsened ever since the loss of the jade, but did not pay it much heed. Then, one day, while Madam Wang was pondering matters, Jia Lian entered to pay his respects, grinning and saying, “Today I heard from Yucun that our Second Master’s household received word from Uncle’s side: our great-uncle has been promoted to Grand Academician of the Cabinet and is en route to the capital. It’s been decreed that on the 20th day of the first month of next year, the official announcement will be made—with 300 li worth of documents sent over. They say our great-uncle will travel day and night, and in a little over half a month he shall arrive. I came here to inform Madam.” Madam Wang, upon hearing this, was overjoyed. Thinking that while her own family’s numbers were sparse, the Xue Aunt’s family was in decline, and her brothers were scattered afar with no one to rely on—suddenly, with a brother taking office in the capital, the Wang family’s glory would be restored, and Baoyu would have support.
Tan-chun then said, “Last night the mistress remarked, ‘Last time, when there was trouble at home, we relied entirely on the Concubine to see things through; now that we have troubles of our own, it is equally hard to manage.’ It seems her mind is troubled.” Madam Xue replied, “I too am deeply grieved at home. But since your eldest brother has suffered this misfortune, and your two other brothers are off handling official matters, what use is your elder sister left alone? Moreover, our daughter-in-law is rather naive and cannot extricate herself from the situation. And now, the county magistrate is busy preparing for Consort Zhou’s memorial assignment, so the case remains unresolved. That is why your two brothers have returned, and I came over to see for myself.” Li Wan then said, “Madam, why don’t you stay with us for a few days? It would be better.” Madam Xue nodded, “I shall remain here to keep you sisters company—only, Bao, you must try to remain calm.” Xi-chun remarked, “Madam, since you’re so concerned, why don’t you also invite Bao, our elder sister, to stay?” Madam Xue smiled and said, “I can’t do that.” Xi-chun pressed, “Why not? Didn’t she already come to stay?” Li Wan replied, “Don’t be upset. Her household is in turmoil now—how could she come?” Trusting Li Wan’s explanation, Xi-chun did not press further. Just then, Grandmother Jia and the others returned. Seeing Madam Xue, they scarcely exchanged greetings before inquiring about Xue Pan’s case. Madam Xue recounted the details. Nearby, Baoyu overheard a mention of Jiang Yuhan and, without asking aloud, thought to himself, “Now that he’s returned to the capital, why hasn’t he come to see me? And Baochai hasn’t either—I wonder what the matter is.” Lost in his thoughts, he was just about to be absorbed in his musings when Daiyu arrived to pay her respects. Baoyu’s heart lifted a little; he quickly abandoned thoughts of Baochai’s absence and joined his sisters for dinner at the old lady’s residence. After the meal, everyone dispersed, and Madam Xue took up temporary lodgings in Grandmother Jia’s private suite. Returning to his own room, Baoyu changed his clothes and suddenly recalled the handkerchief given to him by Jiang Yuhan. He called out to Xiren, “Do you still have that red handkerchief from last year that you didn’t tie?” Xiren replied, “I’ve kept it. What do you need it for?” Baoyu said, “I’m just asking.” Xiren chided, “Haven’t you heard that our eldest uncle’s quarrel with those scoundrels has escalated to a matter of life and death? Why bring that up now? Instead of fretting over such trivial matters, you should devote yourself quietly to your studies and set these unimportant issues aside.” Baoyu replied, “I’m not fussing about it—I merely recalled it. Whether I have it or not is of no consequence. I was just asking, and now you’re making a fuss.” Xiren smiled, “I’m not prattling. A person of learning and propriety should know how to ingratiate himself to superiors. Even when one’s beloved arrives, one must show proper deference.” At the mention of this, Baoyu exclaimed, “Remarkable! Earlier at Grandmother’s, when there were so many people, I couldn’t get a word in with Lin—she didn’t even acknowledge me. And now even Baochai hasn’t come; what is the reason?” Deep in thought about these matters, his mind was already elsewhere. He set off, saying, “I’ll go now. Lin, I’m sure you’re inside; I’ll find you there.” Xiren called after him, “Hurry back! I was the one who mentioned it, and now you’re getting all excited.” Without further reply, Baoyu lowered his head and proceeded to the Xiaoxiang Pavilion.
Now, it happened that Baoyu had been resting at home in a round leather jacket. When he saw the flower in bloom, he went out to have a look, to admire it, to sigh over it, and to express his fondness—his myriad emotions of joy and sorrow, love and separation, all became linked with this very flower. Suddenly, hearing that Jia Mu was about to arrive, he hurriedly changed into a fox-fur sleeved jacket and donned a dark fox-leg surcoat. In his haste, he neglected to fasten the “Tongling Treasure Jade” around his neck. Later, after Jia Mu had departed, he changed again. Xiren noticed that the jade was missing from around Baoyu’s neck and asked, “Where is that piece of jade?”  Baoyu replied, “In the confusion while changing, I took it off and placed it on the kang table—I did not bring it with me.”  Xiren looked around the table but found no jade. She then searched everywhere; its trace was completely gone, and she was struck with cold sweat. Baoyu said, “Don’t worry—it must be somewhere in the house. Just ask around and you’ll know.”  Thinking that they might be playing a trick on him, Xiren smiled and said to the others, “Little ones, are you playing? Where have you hidden this thing? Don’t really lose it—if it goes missing, we’ll all be in deep trouble!”  Mesha and the others, speaking in serious tones, replied, “What are you saying? Play is play, but this matter is no joke. Don’t mix things up. Have you lost your mind? Think—where could it have been placed? Now you’re blaming others!”  Seeing that their expressions were not lighthearted at all, Xiren grew anxious and pleaded, “Heavens, little ancestor! Where on earth did you leave it?”  Baoyu said, “I clearly remember placing it on the kang table. Where exactly are you looking?”  Xiren, Mesha, and the others dared not alert anyone and secretly searched every nook and cranny. After much commotion all day, without any result—even after overturning boxes and chests—they suspected that perhaps one of those people who came in earlier might have taken it away for inspection. Xiren said, “Everyone knows that this jade is as dear as one’s life. Who would dare to tamper with it! For now, keep quiet and search everywhere. If any of the sisters turns out to have taken it to tease us, they must kowtow to get it back; and if any little maid has stolen it, once questioned, she must not be brought before the elders. No matter what compensation is offered to exchange it back, it must be acceptable. This is not a trivial matter—if we truly lose it, it will be even worse than losing Second Master Bao’s favor!”  Just as Mesha and Qiu Wen were about to head out, Xiren hurriedly cautioned, “Those who are dining here, do not begin questioning them first. If we can’t find it, causing further turmoil would be all the worse.” Mesha and the others, following her instructions, split up to search. None could figure it out; everyone was filled with suspicion. Soon, they all returned, dumbfounded and exchanging glances. Baoyu was also frightened, and Xiren was nearly in tears. No one could find it, yet no one dared to return and report either. In the Yihong Courtyard, everyone looked as though they were made of wood or clay. Just as everyone was lost in thought, word came that those who might know of its whereabouts had arrived. Tan Chun ordered the garden gates closed, and first sent an old maid with two maids out to search every corner; then she gathered everyone and announced, “Whoever finds it will be richly rewarded.”  Eager to dissociate themselves from any blame and upon hearing the heavy reward, everyone threw caution to the wind and searched everywhere—even in the outhouses. Yet, no one could locate it. The jade turned out to be as small as an embroidery needle, and after a full day’s search, there was still no sign of it. Li Wan grew anxious and said, “This matter is no laughing matter. I’m about to say something unseemly.”  Everyone asked, “What is it?”  Li Wan said, “At this point, we must get to the bottom of it.
Once our affairs are settled, and your proper matters concluded, I too shall have one less worry.” Xue Ke replied, “Sister, the matter of Qin’s (the zither-playing sister’s) departure has troubled the Mistress greatly. As for that matter—what is there to say?” The conversation continued in idle tones. Later, Xue Ke returned to his own room. After dinner, he recalled that Xiuyan, now living in the Jia Garden, was a poor orphan forced to rely on the goodwill of others, and that her daily needs were barely met. Having known her since the day she arrived—with her appearance and character well understood—he could only sigh over the injustice of fate: how could one like the affluent and spoiled Xia Jinguai be so blessed while a gentle soul like Xiuyan must endure hardship? He wondered how the King of Hell had passed judgment on them. In his melancholy, he attempted to compose a poem to vent his sorrow:    “Like a dragon deprived of water, or a fish left to dry,   Two hearts separated by vast distances, each yearning in solitude. Together in the mire we suffer greatly—   Who knows when we shall reach that realm of emptiness?”  Finishing his verse, he looked it over, intending to paste it on the wall—but feeling embarrassed at the prospect of being mocked, he instead folded it into his book. Lost in thought about his advancing years and the misfortunes that had befallen his family, he mused bitterly on his loneliness and desolation. Just then, Baocan pushed open the door carrying a small box and set it on the table with a cheerful smile. Xue Ke invited him to sit. Baocan said with a grin, “These are four plates of assorted fruits and a small jug of wine—delivered by the Mistress for Second Master.” Xue Ke smiled in return, “The Mistress has been most considerate. Yet why did she have the little maids deliver them personally? What prompted such extra effort?” Baocan replied, “You see, among our own, why should Second Master need such formalities? Moreover, given our elder brother’s troublesome ways, the Mistress has long wished to send something in thanks—but she fears that others might suspect ulterior motives. You know, in our family, if gifts are given, it is simply a matter of goodwill, and no one will fuss about it.” Xue Ke said, “Keep the fruits; as for the wine, let the Mistress take it back. I have little use for my wine now—one cannot drink for the sake of mere habit. Surely even the Mistress and our elder sister understand.” Baocan protested, “I dare not refuse the Mistress’s orders. Our Mistress’s temperament, as you well know, is not easily managed. If I return it, it might be said that I have not done my duty.” Xue Ke had no choice but to leave the wine with him. Baocan, about to depart, peeked out the door and then turned back with a smile, saying, “Soon enough, you’ll be called upon to come in person to offer your thanks.” Xue Ke, unsure what to make of it, felt a flush rise to his cheeks and said, “Please, convey my gratitude to the Mistress. It is cold out; and besides, you and your family need not fuss over these trivialities.” Baocan said nothing more, smiling as he left. Xue Ke initially suspected that Jin Gui’s involvement in the matter regarding Xue Pan might have been a pretext for the Mistress to send wine and fruits to appease him. But when he observed Baocan’s furtive, uneasy manner, he began to wonder. “Could it be,” he thought, “that since Baocan is of the Mistress’s household, he might have his own considerations? Perhaps he is too shy to speak plainly, and by invoking Jin Gui’s name he hopes to divert attention. Or perhaps, given that he is a member of my brother’s household, there is more to it than meets the eye…” Suddenly, another thought struck him: “That Jin Gui, who has never adhered to the strict codes of propriety in the inner quarters—and who sometimes, in a fit of gaiety, dresses in an outrageously coquettish manner, convinced of his own beauty—might harbor ill intentions. Could it be that he and our Qin-sister have been involved in some untoward affair, and have thus contrived this ploy to sully my name?
When Madam Xue read it, fearing Baochai would be anxious, she concealed it and went to beg Madam Wang on Baochai’s behalf, explaining Baochai’s ailment. After Madam Xue left, Madam Wang in turn petitioned Jia Zheng. Jia Zheng remarked, “This matter can be entrusted to higher authority—but on the ground it is difficult; proper measures must be taken.” Madam Wang then brought up Baochai’s case, saying, “That poor child has suffered much. Since she is one of our own, she ought to be married soon so that her delicate body isn’t further harmed.”  Jia Zheng agreed, “I think the same. But her family is in disarray, and now that winter has set in and she is nearing her limit, everyone has their own household affairs to attend to. Let us postpone the match until next spring. After Grandmother’s birthday, we will set a date. For now, convey these words to Mrs. Xue.” Madam Wang assented. The next day, Madam Wang explained Jia Zheng’s decision to Mrs. Xue, and Mrs. Xue concurred. After dinner, Madam Wang accompanied them to Grandmother Jia’s room where everyone was seated. Grandmother Jia asked, “Has the Mistress arrived?” Mrs. Xue replied, “She came yesterday, but since it was late she could not properly greet Grandmother.” Madam Wang then recounted Jia Zheng’s remarks to Grandmother Jia, who was delighted. Soon after, Baoyu entered, and Grandmother Jia asked, “Have you eaten?” Baoyu answered, “I just returned from the study after a meal; I intended to see Grandmother first, and I heard that the Mistress has come to greet her as well.” He then inquired, “Is Baochai well?” Mrs. Xue laughed, “She is well.” At that moment, everyone noticed that Baoyu’s demeanor was less affectionate than before; his heart was filled with suspicion, for he sensed that the Mistress’s warm regard had waned. Without further ado, he returned to the study. That evening, after the formalities, everyone gathered in the Xiaoxiang Hall. When the curtain was drawn, Zijuan met them. “Where is the young miss?” Baoyu asked. Zijuan replied, “She has gone upstairs. I heard that the Mistress has come and she has gone to pay her respects. Didn’t Second Master go upstairs as well?” Baoyu said, “I went, but I did not see any of the young ladies.” Zijuan said, “Really? Then where did they go?” Baoyu replied, “I’m not sure—where did they vanish to?” Zijuan said, “That, I cannot say for certain.” Just as Baoyu was about to leave, he saw Daiyu coming slowly with Snow Goose in tow. “Sister, you have returned,” he said, shrinking back as he accompanied Daiyu. Daiyu led him into the inner room and invited him to sit. Zijuan quickly exchanged her outer garment for another and then asked, “When you went upstairs, did you see the Mistress?” Baoyu said, “Yes, I did.” Daiyu then asked, “Did the Mistress say anything about me?” Baoyu replied, “Not only did she not mention you, but she didn’t even seem to greet me as warmly as before. When I asked about Baochai’s illness, she only smiled without replying. Could it be that it is because I have not visited her these past days?” Daiyu smiled, “Have you visited her?” Baoyu admitted, “I was unaware for the first few days; later, though I learned of it, I still did not go.” Daiyu said, “That is indeed so.” Baoyu sighed, “Truly, Grandmother did not instruct me to visit, nor did the Mistress; and our father did not command it either. In the old days, when the small gate was open, I could visit her ten times a day—but now the gate is barred, and it is nearly impossible to approach.” Daiyu asked, “And how would she ever know the cause?” Baoyu replied, “Baochai is the one who truly cares for me.” Daiyu cautioned, “Do not get the wrong idea.
The young ladies, not understanding the situation, could only sit around until dawn. Although every maid in the garden knew that the nun-like women had been brought in to be employed in the palace, none of them knew the full details. At dawn the next day, just as Jia Zheng was about to leave his office, the hall was distributed with two booklets of provincial market estimates, which he had to inspect immediately. Unable to return home at once, he sent someone back to inform Jia Lian, saying: “Lai Da is back. You must question him thoroughly. Handle the matter as you see fit; there’s no need to wait for me.”  Jia Lian, following orders, though fond of Qin’er, reasoned to himself, “If we handle it too discretely, Jia Zheng might become suspicious. It would be better to go back to Second Madam Ming and ask for her advice. Then if it goes against the old master’s wishes, at least I won’t be held accountable.” Having made up his mind, he went inside to see Madam Wang and explained: “Yesterday, the old master got angry upon seeing that notice and called Qin’er along with the nun-like women and Taoist women into the mansion for inquiry. Today, the old master doesn’t have time to address this inappropriate matter and has sent me back to you to decide on how to handle it. I have come to seek your instructions on this affair.”  Madam Wang was taken aback and said, “What do you mean? If Qin’er behaves in this way, can he still be regarded as one of our family? And that notice itself is repugnant—the words are nothing but a jumble. Have you asked Qin’er whether this matter really occurred?”  Jia Lian replied, “I have just inquired. Madam, even if he didn’t actually do it, who in their right mind would undertake such a scoundrel’s work? Yet I think Qin’er wouldn’t dare to act thus: he knows that those girls were only desired by the mistress for a short time. What if something goes wrong? In my humble opinion, if we ask and it comes out, Madam, how do you propose we handle it?”  Madam Wang asked, “Where are those girls now?”  Jia Lian answered, “They are all locked in the garden.”  “Do the young ladies know?” asked Madam Wang. “They seem to think it’s a matter pertaining to the palace, and nothing else is mentioned outside,” Jia Lian explained. “Very well. This matter cannot be delayed even for a moment. Initially I intended to send them away, but you all insisted they be kept. Now that trouble has arisen, you must tell Lai Da to go back to his original establishment and inquire carefully whether there are any of his kin involved. Get the official documents checked, spend perhaps a few dozen taels of silver to hire a boat and assign a reliable person to deliver everything back to their home, and also return all the documents. That way nothing will be amiss. If, however, it turns out that one or two bad apples have reverted to secular ways, then to detain everyone would be too grievous a sin. And if the matter were to be made public to the authorities—even if we forgo our dowries—if they sell the jade, who would care about their lives? As for Qin’er, give him a good scolding; aside from the ancestral rites and celebrations, he need not be summoned here. Should he inadvertently come into conflict with the old master’s anger, he’ll be in deep trouble. Also, inform the accounts office to cancel the entry for this item of grain and provisions. Then, send someone to Shuiyue Nunnery to relay the old master’s command that aside from the ritual of burning paper for the ancestors, no man from his family is allowed to enter. Should there be any more unfavorable news, even the old maid must be expelled as well.”  Jia Lian agreed to every word. He then went out to relay Madam Wang’s orders to Lai Da, saying, “Madam’s instructions are for you to proceed exactly as she said. Once you have finished, report back to me so I can in turn report to Madam. Hurry on and complete the task. When the old master returns, you must answer according to Madam’s directions.”  Hearing this, Lai Da remarked, “Our Madam truly has a compassionate heart.
Shall I put away your brush and ink?” Daiyu replied, “I have finished; just pack them up.” Then, she went into her inner room and sat on her bed, leaning slightly as she pondered deeply. Zijuan returned and gently asked, “Miss, would you like a cup of tea?” Daiyu answered, “No, I’m not hungry—I’m just feeling a bit off. You all go on.” Zijuan left, and soon Snow Goose was found sitting quietly, lost in thought. Zijuan approached and asked, “Are you troubled too?” Snow Goose, startled out of his reverie, said, “Don’t shout—listen, today I heard something remarkable. Let me tell you, but don’t speak of it aloud.” He then cupped his hand around his mouth as if to keep a secret. Gathering courage, he beckoned Zijuan outside to the doorway, and in a hushed tone he said, “Sister, did you hear? They say that Baoyu has now been betrothed.” Zijuan gasped, “Where did you hear such a thing? It must not be true, must it?” Snow Goose insisted, “It’s as true as can be! Everyone else seems to know, only we hadn’t heard it.” Zijuan asked, “Where did you hear it?” Snow Goose replied, “I overheard the clerk talking—it was said that a certain governor’s family, with ample wealth and renowned talents, is involved.” Just then, they heard a cough from within; it seemed Daiyu was stirring. Fearing she might overhear, Zijuan tugged Snow Goose’s arm and peered discreetly inside. Seeing no movement, she quietly asked, “What exactly did he say?” Snow Goose explained, “Not long ago, I was sent to Third Sister’s to convey thanks, but she wasn’t in—only the clerk was there. While everyone was sitting, someone mentioned that Baoyu, in his playful mischief, is no more like a grown man than a little child—and that he is betrothed, yet still so foolish. I asked, ‘Has it been settled?’ and the clerk replied, ‘Yes—it has been arranged by some Wang, a relative from the Eastern Mansion; so there’s no need for further inquiry.’” Zijuan tilted her head thoughtfully. “That is strange indeed! But why has no one in the household mentioned it?” Snow Goose continued, “The clerk also mentioned it was the old lady’s wish. Once it is spoken of, I fear Baoyu’s wild heart might be stirred, so they keep it under wraps. The clerk warned me not to let it slip—and indeed, he did not mention it in front of Baoyu today.” Just then, a parrot squawked, mimicking, “Miss, come back! Quickly, serve tea!” Both Zijuan and Snow Goose jumped in surprise. Looking around for the source and finding no one, they scolded the parrot. Returning inside, they found Daiyu, panting slightly as she had just sat on a chair. Zijuan and Snow Goose exchanged glances over tea and water. Daiyu then asked, “Where did you two go? Now not a single soul is to be seen.” With that, she went to the kang, leaned back, pulled aside her quilt, and lay down, urging that the covering be removed. Zijuan and Snow Goose, suspecting that her earlier conversation might have reached her ears, chose not to mention it further. But Daiyu’s heart, already full of inner turmoil, had caught seven or eight parts of what they said, as if her soul were adrift in a vast sea. Reflecting on past omens and overwhelmed by bitter regrets, she resolved that it might be better to die soon rather than live on to witness unexpected misfortune. Reminding herself of her lifelong sorrow from losing her parents and the continual erosion of her life day by day, she decided that in time she would attain a state of serene detachment. With that grim resolve, she neither gathered new clothes nor cared for her meals, and simply lay down pretending to sleep. Even though Zijuan and Snow Goose attended her several times, seeing no movement she dared not disturb her. She skipped dinner entirely. After the lights were lit, Zijuan lifted the quilt to see that Daiyu had indeed fallen asleep, the blanket carelessly kicked off at the foot.
I also heard that the Ministry of Works has announced a vacancy for a Langzhong (a junior physician) position, and both outsiders and officials are saying that His Lordship intends to appoint someone.” Jia Zheng said, “Well, just look at that.” Lin Zhixiao said a few more words and then departed. Meanwhile, Zhen, Lian, and Baoyu returned, while only Baoyu lingered near Grandmother Jia’s side. He recounted how kindly the Prince of Bejing had treated him, and even produced the piece of jade. Everyone looked at it and laughed for a moment. Grandmother Jia then ordered, “Put it away for him, so that it isn’t lost.” She then asked, “Do take good care of that jade, don’t let it get mixed up with other things.” Baoyu then took it off his neck and said, “Isn’t this my piece of jade? It nearly fell off. In comparison, the other piece is far superior; it simply cannot be matched! I was just about to tell the old lady: the other night, when I was sleeping, I took it down from my neck and hung it by the curtain—and it suddenly shone so brightly that the whole tent was bathed in a red glow.” Grandmother Jia replied, “Nonsense. The eaves of the curtain are red, and with the firelight, naturally there is a red glow.” Baoyu said, “No, at that time the lights were out and the room was pitch dark—yet I could still see it.” Both Second Madame Xing and Madame Wang pursed their lips in amusement. Sister Feng said, “It must be that good news spreading.” Baoyu asked, “What good news?” Grandmother Jia said, “You wouldn’t understand. You’ve been babbling all day—now go and rest a bit, and don’t spout nonsense here.” Baoyu stood there a while longer before finally returning to the garden. At this point, Grandmother Jia asked, “By the way, did you all go to see the Concubine and mention this matter?” Madame Wang replied, “We were planning to, but Sister Feng’s little maid was delayed by Qiao Jie’er’s illness, so we only went today. We mentioned the matter to her, and her aunt was quite willing—she only said that Pan’er is not home at this time, and since her father is gone, they must discuss and decide together later.” Grandmother Jia said, “That makes sense. In that case, let’s not bring it up now; we’ll wait until they have discussed it over there.”  Not long after Grandmother Jia had finished discussing marriage matters, Baoyu returned to his own room and told Xiren, “Grandmother and Sister Feng were just talking in vague terms—what did they mean by that?” Xiren thought for a moment and smiled, “I can’t guess either. But weren’t those remarks made while Miss Lin was absent?” Baoyu replied, “Miss Lin has been ill—she never goes to Grandmother’s side during these times.” Just then, voices were heard from the outer room—Mèiyuè and Qiuwen were quarreling. Xiren asked, “What are you two arguing about now?” Mèiyuè said, “We were playing cards. He won some money from me and kept it; when he lost money, he wouldn’t pay up. That might be acceptable, but he actually snatched all my money!” Baoyu laughed and said, “What’s a few coins anyway? Silly thing—stop fussing.” The two mumbled and eventually sat down. Xiren then sent Baoyu off to sleep, and that’s that. Meanwhile, after hearing Baoyu’s earlier words—which clearly alluded to him being “proposed” to—Xiren, fearing that Baoyu might become infatuated and say more foolish things, pretended not to know. Yet in her heart this matter troubled her deeply. Lying in bed that night, she devised a plan: perhaps she should visit Zijuan to see if there were any developments so that she might learn more. The next morning, after sending Baoyu off to school and after her own grooming, she leisurely made her way to the Xiaoxiang Pavilion.
You think of him, and so do I. Our own person is growing ever more infatuated! Judging by that expression, she must have her eyes set on Baoyu—those repeated illnesses, aren’t they due to this matter? With all the ‘gold’ and ‘silver’ in the household in disarray, now add in some Miss Fu—it’s just too extraordinary. I reckon Baoyu’s heart might be with our girl as well. Listening to Yuanyang, he seems to fall for every pretty face. Isn’t it that we girls have all been fretting in vain?”  Zizhuan had originally been thinking of Daiyu, but soon found herself at a loss as to whom to favor, her mind clouded with infatuation. She wished she could tell Daiyu not to worry, yet feared that might only add to her distress; seeing Daiyu like this was indeed pitiful. After much vacillation, she became agitated and scolded herself, “Why do you waste your worry on others? Even if Lin Miss truly is made for Baoyu, his temperament is hard to restrain. Though Baoyu is of a gentle nature, he tends to bite off more than he can chew. I advise that we need not fuss over it—my own worry is enough. From now on, I’ll devote myself entirely to serving our girl, and let everything else go.” With that thought, she felt a sense of relief. Returning to the Xiaoxiang Pavilion, she found Daiyu sitting alone on the kang, revising her old manuscripts of poems and essays. Lifting her head as she saw Zizhuan enter, Daiyu asked, “Where have you been?”  Zizhuan replied, “Today I visited the other sisters.”  “Were you looking for Sister Xiren?” Daiyu inquired. Zizhuan said, “Why should I look for her?”  For a moment, Daiyu wondered, “How did that slip out so easily?” Feeling somewhat embarrassed, she retorted, “Whether you look or not is none of your concern! Go serve some tea.”  Zizhuan silently chuckled and went off to fetch tea. Suddenly, a clamor arose in the garden, the source unknown. While serving tea, Zizhuan sent someone to investigate. The messenger soon reported: “In the Yihong Courtyard, several of the Haitang trees had withered from neglect, with no one attending to them. Yesterday, Baoyu went to have a look and noticed what seemed to be a bud on one of the branches, but no one paid any heed. Then, today, the Haitang flower bloomed splendidly, astonishing everyone—they all rushed to see it. Even the old lady and Madam were excited and came to view the flower. That is why the Grand Madam ordered for the leaves in the garden to be cleared, and these people are now being summoned there.”  Daiyu, having heard this and knowing that the old lady was coming, changed her clothes and sent Xueyan to ask, “If the old lady arrives, come and tell me immediately.” Not long after, Xueyan hurried back saying, “The old lady and Madam have gathered quite a few people. Please go now, girl.”  Daiyu quickly glanced at herself in the mirror, brushed back her side hair, and, leaning on Zizhuan, went to the Yihong Courtyard. There she saw the old lady sitting on the divan where Baoyu usually reclined. Daiyu immediately said, “Please greet the old lady.” Stepping back, she then encountered the Second Wife of Prince Xing; after that, she met Li Wan, Tan Chun, Xi Chun, and Xing Xiuyan, exchanging pleasantries. Only Feng Jie was absent due to illness; Shi Xiangyun had returned to the capital with her uncle on a transfer; Xue Baoqin was staying with her elder sister; and the Li sisters, because of the tumult in the garden, had been sent out by Aunt Li to reside elsewhere. So, today, Daiyu saw only a few people. After a short while of laughter and conversation about the strangely blooming flower, Jia Mu said, “These flowers normally bloom in March. Though it is now November, owing to the delayed season—more like October in a mild ‘little spring’—with warm weather, the flowers can indeed bloom.”  Madam Wang added, “The old lady has seen many, so she’s not surprised.”  Lady Xing remarked, “I heard that these flowers had withered for an entire year.
The sudden chaos woke the Taoist nun and other attendant nuns, who rushed in with torches to check on her. They found Miaoyu’s hands flung wide, frothing at the mouth. As they roused her, her eyes were wide open, her cheeks flushed bright red, and she shouted, “I am protected by the Buddha! How dare you ruffians threaten me?” The attendants, utterly confused, urged, “We are here—please calm down and wake!” Miaoyu insisted, “I must return home! If there is any honest soul, send me back immediately.” The nun replied, “This is your residence,” and called for other nuns to hastily pray before the Guanyin statue. They drew lots, and upon reading the lot, found that she had offended a malevolent spirit in the southwest corner. One said, “Indeed, in the southwest corner of the Grand View Garden no one resides—yet the sinister qi remains.” Meanwhile, the nuns scrambled about with water and soup. One of the nuns, who had accompanied Miaoyu from the south, devoted herself to serving her faithfully, seating herself around Miaoyu’s meditation mat. Miaoyu looked up and asked, “Who are you?” The nun replied, “It is I.” Miaoyu examined her closely and said, “Ah, it is you!” Overcome, she embraced the nun and wept, “You are like a mother to me—if you do not save me, I cannot live!” The nun called for help and gently massaged her, while the Taoist nun poured her some tea. Only at dawn did Miaoyu fall asleep. The nun then sent someone to fetch a physician. Some said her condition was due to spleen injury from overthinking, others attributed it to heat in the blood, or to an invasion of evil spirits, while still others believed it was simply an external cold; ultimately, no consensus was reached. Finally, a doctor arrived, asked, “Have you been meditating?” The Taoist nun answered, “Yes, she has meditated regularly.” The doctor inquired, “Did this ailment come on suddenly last night?” The nun confirmed, “Indeed.” The doctor explained, “This is the result of the demon within stirring up fire.” When asked if it was serious, he replied, “Fortunately, her meditation was short, and the demon’s influence was shallow—there is hope for recovery.” He prescribed medicine to subdue the inner fire, and after one dose, her condition slightly improved. Outside, rumors began to circulate among the wandering idlers: “At such an age, how can one endure this? Moreover, with her elegant yet refined nature, who knows in whose hands she will eventually fall?” After several days, though Miaoyu’s illness improved somewhat, her spirit remained unsettled, and she continued to be somewhat disoriented. One day, as Xi-chun sat in quiet contemplation, Caiping suddenly entered and said, “Miss, have you heard about what happened to Miaoyu, our master’s disciple?” Xi-chun asked, “What happened?” Caiping replied, “Yesterday I overheard Miss Xing and the eldest lady saying that after she played chess with you that day, that very night she suddenly fell ill, exclaiming that bandits were coming to rob her. To this day she has not recovered. Miss, isn’t this a strange affair?” Xi-chun was silent. She thought, “Though Miaoyu is pure and untainted, her worldly ties have not been completely severed. Alas, I was born into such a family that I cannot enter monastic life. If I were to become a nun, would I be tormented by evil spirits? With not a single thought arising, all attachments would vanish.” In that moment, inspiration struck her, and she recited spontaneously:    “In the great Dao there is no fixed method—what then is to be? Having come from emptiness, one must return to emptiness.”  After composing these lines, she ordered a maid to burn some incense. Sitting quietly for a while, she reopened her chess manual and read several chapters authored by Kong Rong, Wang Jixin, and others. The sections titled “The Crab Encirclement of Lush Leaves” and “The Oriole’s Chase of the Hare” were not unusual; but the “Thirty-Six Moves to Kill a Corner” proved most perplexing, and even “The Ten Dragons Galloping” struck her as particularly interesting.
Although there are a few strands of reed-root mustache, they are not of the finest quality and are needed daily for the decoction.” Hearing this, Madame Wang then inquired with Mrs. Xing, saying, “Because we ran out last time, I came here to look; it appears they have all been used up.” Having no alternative, Madame Wang resolved to personally ask Grandmother Jia. Grandmother Jia immediately ordered Yuan Yang to bring out the remaining supplies from that very day – and lo, there was a large bundle still kept, with pieces of varying thickness; she weighed out two taels and handed them over to Madame Wang. Madame Wang then sent them with Zhou Ruijia’s servant to the physician’s house. She also ordered that the remaining unidentified packets be taken along so the doctor could inspect them and label each package accordingly. Before long, Zhou Ruijia returned and said, “All these packets have now been labeled. However, that one packet of ginseng, though excellent, is far too old. No matter how well it may have been preserved, after a hundred years it turns to ash. And though this batch has not yet crumbled to ash, it has become rotten and withered—devoid of strength. Please, madame, discard these; it matters not if the pieces are thick or thin, you must exchange them for fresh ones.” Hearing this, Madame Wang lowered her head in silence for a long while before saying, “There is no other way; we must go and buy two taels of new ginseng.” Unwilling to pay further attention to the matter, she commanded, “Gather everything up.” Then she instructed Zhou Ruijia, “Go and tell those outside to select the best and exchange them for two taels. And if, by any chance, Grandmother inquires, just say that these are Grandmother’s supplies – do not mention more.” Just then, as Zhou Ruijia was about to depart, Miss Bao, who had been seated, laughed and said, “Madame, hold on a moment. Nowadays none of the ginseng available is good. Even if one finds whole stems, they are always cut into two or three pieces, mounted with reed mustache and mixed with other materials to be marketable—they look rough. In our shop we often trade with the merchants; I have spoken to Mother already, and Brother will send a fellow over to request two taels of original ginseng stems from the traders. Perhaps we should be willing to pay a bit more silver so that we may finally secure a good batch.” Madame Wang smiled, “Indeed, you understand well. But you must personally go over and see for yourself.” So Miss Bao went, and after a while returned saying, “I have sent someone; by tonight we should have a reply. Tomorrow morning, we may proceed with the order.” Madame Wang, delighted, said, “‘The oil-selling maid combs her hair with water.’ In our household there is always enough to give to others – yet now when it comes to our own use, we find ourselves scrambling about to find it.” With a long sigh, she added. Miss Bao laughed, “Although this material is valuable, it is but medicine; it ought to be shared among the people. We cannot compare ourselves with families who have never seen the world – once we obtain it, we treasure it secretively.” Madame Wang nodded, “You speak truly.”  Soon after Miss Bao left, seeing no one else in the room, Madame Wang called Zhou Ruijia and asked, “Have you found any conclusion regarding the garden search from the other day?” Zhou Ruijia reported that he had already discussed it with Miss Feng; everything was settled without hiding a word, and he returned to report the news to Madame Wang. Madame Wang was startled. Recalling that Si Qi was one of the maidservants from Yingchun’s side, she had no choice but to send someone to follow up with Mrs. Xing. Zhou Ruijia then reported, “Just the other day, that madame over there—angry at Wang Shanbao’s meddling—had given him several slaps. Now he is feigning illness at home and will not come forward. Moreover, he is the granddaughter of her husband; after being slapped, he can only pretend to have forgotten, and in time the matter will be settled. But now, if we return over there, I fear their suspicions will only increase—it would look as though we are meddling. Why not simply bring Si Qi over, along with the incriminating evidence, so that the other madame may see it?
“If you’re inviting me, why trouble yourself to frighten me?” he said with a smile, and he returned to the Yi Hong Courtyard. Soon after, Xiren asked, “Where on earth have you been for so long?” Baoyu replied, “I was at Lin’s place. We began discussing matters concerning my ‘Baojie’ at the Xue household, and I ended up sitting there for a while.” Xiren then inquired, “What did you talk about?” Baoyu recounted a passage of Zen-like words he had blurted out. Xiren scolded lightly, “You never stick to common family chatter or recite a few proper poems for conversation—why must you always slip into Zen talk? You’re no monk!” Baoyu retorted, “You don’t understand—among us, there are our own Zen insights that no one else can interrupt.” Xiren laughed, “All your Zen musings just end up making us sound like we’re beating a dead drum!” Baoyu explained, “I was young, and he was also childlike, so when I spoke carelessly he became offended. Now that I have learned to restrain myself, he no longer seems angry. But lately he hasn’t come around much, and when I study I feel as if we’ve grown estranged.” Xiren said, “That’s just as it should be. We’re all older now; it’s hardly proper to behave like children.” Baoyu nodded. “I know. But let me ask you—did anyone from Grandmother’s side send word about what she said?” Xiren replied, “She didn’t say anything.” Baoyu sighed, “Surely Grandmother must have forgotten. Isn’t tomorrow the first day of the Eleventh Month? Every year, Grandmother always holds a Winter Solstice Gathering—everyone sits together to drink and laugh. I already took a leave from the study today. Without any word, what shall I do tomorrow? If I go, it will have been a wasted leave; if I don’t, then Father will know and say I’m shirking my duties.” Xiren replied, “As far as I’m concerned, you’ll go. You’ve already studied quite a bit and now seem eager for a break. I advise you to get up early tomorrow. Yesterday, I heard the Mistress remark that Lan, our “Lan Ge,” studies very well—when he comes back from the study, he even composes essays every night, sometimes not sleeping until the fourth watch. You, being older and an uncle to the younger ones, mustn’t fall behind and incur Grandmother’s displeasure. It’s better to get up early tomorrow.” Mèiyue interjected, “But in this cold weather—if you’ve already taken leave, why force yourself to go? It would simply mark you as a slacker. I say enjoy a day of rest. Even if Grandmother forgets, why not have a little gathering here ourselves?” Xiren snapped, “You, you little runt! When we’re speaking properly, you start rambling nonsense again.” Mèiyue retorted, “I’m not just rambling—I’m doing it for your sake.” Xiren demanded, “For my sake? Explain!” Mèiyue replied, “Since Second Master has left for the study, you’re always moping and wishing he’d return so we can chat merrily. Now you’re pretending you’re not involved—why the fuss? I can see it clearly.” Xiren was about to scold him when suddenly someone from Grandmother’s side came to announce, “Grandmother has sent word that Second Master is not required to attend the study tomorrow. She has invited the Mistress over to keep him company, though she fears all the young ladies will come to the house. Shi, Xing, and Li—every one of them has been invited. So what need is there for a Winter Solstice Gathering?” Before Baoyu could finish listening, he grinned and exclaimed, “Isn’t that right? Grandmother is most delighted. Not having to attend classes is certainly a blessing.” Xiren could only remain silent. The maid went off. After diligently studying for a few days, Baoyu longed to enjoy a day of play.
Seeing him thus attired, Xue Ke invited him in with a polite smile and asked, “What brings you up so early?”  Baocan blushed and said nothing, but simply folded the fruit into a small dish and departed. Observing his departure, Xue Ke surmised that whatever had transpired the previous night had been set in motion. He thought, “So be it; if they are angry enough, they may have completely made up their minds—and that spares me the trouble of further entanglement.” With his heart at last easing, he ordered someone to fetch water to wash his face and resolved to remain at home for a few days to recuperate, fearing that if he ventured out, someone might come looking for him. Meanwhile, those who had long been on friendly terms with Xue Pan—seeing that the Xue household was empty except for the young, inexperienced Xue Ke—began to covet his position. Some schemed to insert themselves as errand runners; others, capable of serving as assistants or scribes, hoped to manage his affairs; still others planned to extort money from him; and there were even those who spread menacing rumors. Xue Ke, noticing these intruders from afar, did his best to avoid them, though he dared not confront them directly for fear of provoking an unforeseen calamity. Instead, he hid within his home, awaiting further developments—a matter he did not elaborate on. That very night, Jin Gui had sent Baocan some wine and fruit to “probe” Xue Ke’s condition, and Baocan returned and recounted every detail of Xue Ke’s plight. When Jin Gui found that events were not proceeding entirely to his liking, he feared that the whole affair might backfire and that Baocan would look down on him; he tried to cover his tracks with a few evasive remarks but found himself at a loss. Distraught and seated in silent contemplation, Jin Gui had no clear plan until he resolved, at last, that perhaps the next morning he should go retrieve his belongings and, without even washing, change into one or two sets of delicately colored garments—thereby displaying a languid, unkempt charm that might provoke a reaction in Xue Ke. His thought was that if Xue Ke showed any sign of remorse, he would naturally withdraw, leaving Jin Gui’s scheme intact. When, at daybreak, Jin Gui encountered Xue Ke, who still appeared as he had the previous night—no trace of debauchery—Jin Gui pretended nothing was amiss. Instead, he returned with a dish, deliberately leaving behind the wine jug as a signal for further plotting. At that moment, Jin Gui asked, “When you went out, did anyone notice you?” Baocan replied, “No.” “Did Second Master question you?” Jin Gui continued. “Not at all,” Baocan answered. Jin Gui, having spent a sleepless night and still uncertain, mused, “If I were to set this plan in motion, how can Baocan possibly keep it hidden? Perhaps I should offer him a share so that he will have no objections. Moreover, since I cannot act on my own, I must rely on him to execute the plan. Let’s agree on a firm course of action.” With a wry smile, he then asked, “Tell me, what sort of man is our Second Master really?” Baocan shrugged and said, “He appears rather foolish.” Jin Gui laughed, “You speak as if you’ve had plenty of experience with men! No wonder our elder brother could never do without you at home.” Baocan only smirked and replied, “It is his failure to heed our Mistress’s wishes that I mention it.” “Explain how he has failed me,” demanded Jin Gui. Baocan said, “Our Mistress offers him the finest food, yet he refuses to eat—does that not betray her kindness?” He winked conspiratorially. “Don’t let your tongue run away with you,” Jin Gui chided. “I don’t understand your meaning.” Baocan laughed, “Oh, Mistress, worry not—I have only one heart to offer. But these matters must remain secret; if word gets out, it will all be ruined.” Jin Gui’s face flushed. “You little runt—you’re acting as if you’ve seduced countless men! No wonder our elder brother couldn’t live without you.” Baocan merely grinned and replied, “I serve our Mistress faithfully; as for our elder brother’s affairs, you know well what they are.” Thus, Jin Gui’s attempts to sow discord and manipulate the situation continued.
At that moment, Feng Xifeng and Ping’er began to discuss those who might be spreading rumors. “It’s not as if we want Yuanyang to be inconvenienced—surely this is our fault!” they muttered. Just then someone announced, “The Mistress has arrived!”  Feng Xifeng, startled and uncertain of what was happening, quickly and anxiously went out with Ping’er to greet the Mistress. Meanwhile, Wang Furen’s face had grown stern; she entered accompanied only by a maid and, without a word, went into the inner room. Feng Xifeng quickly offered tea and, trying to maintain a smiling facade, asked, “Madam, are you in good spirits today? Have you come to take a stroll?”  Wang Furen curtly commanded, “Ping’er, go out!”  Ping’er, taken aback, immediately replied and led several young maids outside, standing by the door while closing it behind them. Then, she herself sat on the steps, ensuring no one could re-enter. Feng Xifeng, seeing this, grew anxious and asked, “Madam, what is the matter?”  Wang Furen, tearfully, reached into her sleeve and tossed out a perfumed sachet, exclaiming, “Look!”  Feng Xifeng quickly picked it up; it was a richly embroidered, multicolored ‘Spring Joy’ sachet. Shocked, she asked, “Madam, where did you get this?”  Wang Furen, trembling and weeping even more, replied, “Where did I get it? I was sitting by the well—and I thought you were as attentive as I am! But it seems that in broad daylight this item was found by one of Grandmother’s maids on a rock in the garden. Before you know it, it would have been delivered to Grandmother. Tell me, how did it come to be there?”  Feng Xifeng, now even more flustered, asked, “Madam, how can you be certain it’s mine?”  Wang Furen, crying and lamenting, said, “How can I tell? Aside from you, what other women in our household would dare possess such an item? It is said that if a young lady is seen with this, even servants would not miss it. If any maid were to find it and then let it be known, our reputation would be ruined!”  Feng Xifeng, overcome with both anger and shame, lowered her face and knelt at the step, weeping quietly as she confided, “Madam, I truly never intended for this to happen. That very sachet was a copy made from outside—its tassels and all were market-bought. Though I am young and do not consider myself haughty, I would never display such things openly. Even if I possessed one, I would keep it hidden in private; I could not possibly wear it for all to see. Besides, if it were to appear in the garden where all our sisters mingle, not only would they see it, but so would the servants—what meaning would that have? Moreover, even if I had one, I would only use it privately. You, as a refined young lady, must understand.”  Wang Furen’s eyes filled with tears as she listened. Overcome, she ordered Feng Xifeng to rise. Meanwhile, Jia Lian appeared and, after a few exchanges, Feng Xifeng confided privately that she had to borrow silver for a matter involving “Liu Jin Feng.” Jia Lian grinned and said, “Tell me, what’s the matter?”  Feng Xifeng explained that earlier, while discussing with others, someone had accused Liu Er Xifu and her sister of colluding during their gambling sessions, claiming that everything the younger sister did was done under her direction. “I thought you—who always advise me—would say that it’s better for us to have fewer matters to worry about, so that I can take care of myself. But I didn’t listen, and now I’ve ended up offending the Mistress and even contracting an illness as a result. I see no other recourse but to let them run their course; after all, there are plenty of others. I wasted my time and now face the curse of thousands—better that I nurse my own health. When I recover, I shall be a model of propriety and enjoy life, leaving all disputes to them.”  Ping’er laughed and said, “Madam, you truly are something else—our destiny indeed!”  Before long, Jia Lian entered and, clapping his hands with a sigh, declared, “Trouble has broken out again!
They rushed inside to report it. That day, when Jia Zheng and Jia She had been out, only Jia Lian was at home. When they returned, Jia Lian asked, “Is it genuine?” A gatekeeper replied, “I saw it with my own eyes. But I cannot hand it over without first showing it to our master—one hand for the silver, the other for the jade.” Jia Lian was delighted. He quickly reported to Madam Wang, and later to Jia Mu, while Xiren clapped her hands in joyful prayer. Jia Mu, however, was unyielding. He ordered, “Hurry, have Lian’er invite that man into the study so we may examine the jade. If it is as stated, we will pay him the silver immediately.” Following orders, Jia Lian invited the man in and treated him as a guest, thanking him profusely: “If I may borrow this jade until I present it to our master—and I promise not to shortchange you in silver—please.” The man had no choice but to send over a package wrapped in red silk. When Jia Lian unwrapped it, was it not the same translucent, beautiful jade? Jia Lian, who had never been one to question such things, now took a keen look. After a long while, he could almost make out the inscriptions—words like “ward off evil” and so on. Delighted, Jia Lian called for the servants and hurried to present it to Jia Mu and Madam Wang. The whole family was stirred; everyone eagerly gathered to examine it. Fengjie, upon seeing Jia Lian come in, snatched it immediately, unwilling to let anyone else see it first, and delivered it to Jia Mu. Jia Lian laughed and said, “To think such a trivial matter would allow me to score a merit!” When Jia Mu unwrapped the jade, he noticed that it seemed considerably duller than before. He rubbed it with his hand, and Yuanyang put on her spectacles to inspect it. “Strange,” she said, “this jade indeed is something—but where has the brilliant luster vanished?” Madam Wang, after examining it for a while, could not recognize it either and called Fengjie over. Fengjie observed, “It does look familiar, though the color is somewhat off. Perhaps we should have Baoyu examine it himself—then all will be clear.” Xiren, who was watching from the side, also looked on, silently praying that it truly was the one, though she dared not voice any doubts. Thus, Fengjie took the jade from Jia Mu’s hands and, together with Xiren, brought it to Baoyu for his inspection. At that moment, Baoyu, who had just awakened from sleep, lazily accepted it without closely inspecting, and tossed it to the ground, saying, “Here you go—yet again, you are trying to fool me.” He merely gave a cold laugh. Fengjie quickly retrieved the jade and said, “Isn’t it strange? How can you know it without even looking?” Baoyu did not reply, only smiling. Madam Wang then entered the room and, upon seeing him like this, said, “There is nothing more to say. That jade was always one of those mysterious objects born with you—of a kind that makes sense only to you. It appears that this very piece must have been crafted by someone upon seeing the posted notice.” At that moment, everyone suddenly realized the truth. Outside in another room, Jia Lian overheard these remarks and said, “If that’s not so, then quickly bring it here so I may ask him about it. For one to behave in such a manner and then still have the nerve to fool around!” Jia Mu scolded him, “Lian’er, just take it to him and tell him to go on his way. He is, after all, a desperate man with nowhere else to turn. Seeing that our household has such circumstances, he thought he could make a little money by selling this off. In the end, he squandered his money on this thing and now expects us to recognize it. I say, let us not trouble him further—simply return the jade to him with a small reward of silver. Once word gets out and others know he did so, they won’t dare bring it in.” Jia Lian assented and went out.
Miaoyu sneered and said, “My association with you was because you are not one for the world of money-grubbers. And now, why should I be pestered by these rumors? Besides, I don’t even know what you mean by ‘spirit-writing’.” With that, he seemed about to dismiss her. Xiuyan, chagrined by his temper and realizing that she had already let slip too much, thought, I might as well say what I must so it won’t all be for nothing on my return. Not wishing to press him to prove his ability in spirit-writing, she merely smiled and recounted to him—along with Xiren and the others—a message of a mysterious connection involving fate and relationships. Seeing that Miaoyu showed the slightest reaction, she rose and bowed several times. Miaoyu sighed, “Why should one do the bidding of others? Since coming to the capital, I’ve had no one to consult with—but today, by exception, you come to me. I fear that in future you might not leave me in peace.” Xiuyan replied, “I cannot help myself; I know you are kind. And even if others come to seek your help later, who would dare force you?” Miaoyu gave a slight smile and then ordered the incense attendant to light incense. He rummaged in a box for the sand-table and spirit board, wrote a talisman, and instructed Xiuyan in the rites. After she had performed the necessary bows and prayers, Miaoyu and Xiuyan together proceeded with the spirit-writing. Before long, the spirit wrote:    Ah! In coming, leave no trace; in departing, not a mark remains. Beneath the ancient pine at the foot of Qinggeng Peak—   Chase it if you will, though countless mountains lie in your way;   Enter my door and share a smile, and all shall be revealed. When the writing was complete, and the spirit-writing session ended, Xiuyan asked, “Which immortal was summoned?” Miaoyu answered, “The ‘Wayward Immortal’.” Xiuyan recorded the words and went to seek Miaoyu’s further explanation. But Miaoyu replied, “I cannot say any more; even I do not fully understand. You must take this along—there are many clever people out there.” Xiuyan had no choice but to return empty-handed. Entering the courtyard, everyone asked, “What did it say?” Xiuyan, without time to detail everything, simply handed the spirit-writing scroll to Li Wan. All the sisters and Baoyu crowded around to read it, and they interpreted its meaning as: “Though you search for it now, it cannot be found; yet once lost, it shall not remain so forever. But where is Qinggeng Peak?” Li Wan mused, “This is an immortal riddle. How could a Qinggeng Peak ever emerge within our household? It must be that someone, fearful of being discovered, has hidden it beneath a stone where a pine grows. Yet the line ‘enter my door’—whose door is meant here?” Daiyu asked, “I wonder, whose immortal are we summoning?” Xiuyan answered, “The Wayward Immortal.” Tan Chun remarked, “If it is an immortal’s door, then it is hard to enter.” Xiren, anxious, began to search high and low—peeking under every stone—but to no avail. Returning to the courtyard, Baoyu made no further inquiry but only smiled foolishly. Mesha fretted, “Little ancestor, exactly where did you lose it? Explain yourself! Otherwise, we will all be punished, and our disgrace will be out in the open.” Baoyu laughed, “I said it was lost out there; yet you all refuse to believe me. Now you ask me—how could I possibly know?” Li Wan and Tan Chun said, “It’s already past the second watch of the night. Look—Miss Lin has lost her composure and gone her own way. We should rest; let the matter be discussed again tomorrow.” With that, the crowd dispersed. Baoyu soon retired for the night, still smiling in his foolish way. Poor Xiren and the others wept and pondered, lying awake the whole night—no detail is worth recounting here. Meanwhile, Daiyu returned to her room and recalled the old tales about “gold” and “jade.” This filled her with a secret delight as she mused, “The words of monks and priests are hardly to be trusted.
This news was delivered in hushed tones as if it were a grave matter. Madame Wang said, “Nonsense! How can these girls so easily enter the Buddhist order? Anyone who wishes to do so must follow the proper rites. I, being kind-hearted, have vowed that all are equal in the Buddha’s eyes. Now, since a few girls, fatherless and far from home, have known both wealth and hardship from an early age, and now wish to escape their miseries by entering the order, then perhaps ‘turning back from the bitter sea’ and embracing the monastic life might indeed be their wish. But do not let me hinder such benevolence.” Being a kind soul herself, Madame Wang at first listened as if it were merely the ramblings of children; but with recent household troubles and news from Mrs. Xing that Yingchun’s family would soon be invited to stay for two days so that they might be seen, and with official channels already in motion, her heart grew heavy with matters beyond such trifles. Thus, she laughed and said, “Then you two shall take them as your apprentices.” Her two maternal aunts, hearing this, bowed deeply and exclaimed, “Excellent, excellent! In that case, our late madame’s merits are considerable indeed.” Madame Wang then said, “Inquire of him. If he is sincere, then come up here and formally become a disciple in my presence.” The three girls who had gone out eventually returned with the three young apprentices. Madame Wang questioned them repeatedly; once they made up their minds, they kowtowed with the two aunts and then excused themselves. Seeing that their minds were determined and that she could no longer force the matter, Madame Wang’s anger softened into pity. She quickly ordered that some gifts be gathered for them and also sent gifts to the two aunts. From that day onward, Fangguan became attached to Zhì Tōng of Shuiyue Temple, while Rui Guan and Ou Guan went with Yuán Xìn of Dizang Temple; the three of them subsequently left home and entered the monastic life. Now, as for what follows, we shall continue in the next installment. Chapter 79: Xue Wenqi’s Regret at Marrying a Ferocious “River-Dong” and Jia Yingchun’s Mistaken Marriage to a “Zhongshan Wolf”  After Bao Yu had just finished offering sacrifices for Qingwen, a sound of voices was suddenly heard from beneath the flowering shade—which startled everyone. Looking closely, it was none other than Daiyu herself, with a smiling countenance as she said, “What a novel eulogy! It could stand alongside the ‘Cao E Stele’ in renown.” Bao Yu, hearing this, blushed and laughed, “I thought that all the traditional memorial inscriptions have become stale, so I tried to create something new. It was merely a fleeting fancy of mine, and who would have thought you would hear it! There is nothing untoward in modifying it—why not refine it a bit?” Daiyu replied, “Where is your original draft? I would like to examine it in detail. It is a long, elaborate piece—I only caught the middle couplet, which goes ‘Within the red silk curtains, the young master’s affection runs deep; in the yellow earth on the hills, the daughter’s fate is thin’—and that line is rather fine. But ‘within the red silk curtains’ seems too commonplace. Given that there is an already existing true story, why not use that instead?” Bao Yu hurriedly asked, “What true story do you mean?” Daiyu smiled and said, “Since our windows are now draped in rosy gauze, why not say, ‘Beneath the scarlet gauze window, the young master is exceedingly amorous’?” Bao Yu couldn’t help but stamp his foot in laughter, “Excellent, excellent! It shows you can come up with such ideas. Clearly, the world abounds with ready-made splendid scenes and events; it is only we simpletons who fail to think of them. Yet even if this revised version is extraordinarily clever, it suits you here while you remain—but I truly cannot claim credit for it.” He added humbly, “I dare not take full credit.” Daiyu laughed, “No matter—I may well let my window serve as your window; there is no need to make a formal distinction, that would only seem too distant and unfamiliar.
The moment your brother returned home, he begged madame repeatedly to seek her hand. Our madame had met her before and, given that their statuses matched, agreed. After discussing with the other secondary wives and Miss Feng, arrangements were made. It was just that the wedding happened so hastily that everything became chaotic. I too wished she would come earlier, and thereby added another poet to our midst.” Bao Yu sneered, “Even if so, I worry for you.” Xiangling asked, “What do you mean?” Bao Yu laughed, “What do you not understand? I fear that if another person comes along, Brother Xue will no longer show you any tenderness.” Xiangling blushed and asked sharply, “What do you mean by that? We have always respected and cared for each other, yet today you speak of such things. No wonder everyone says you are unapproachable.” As she spoke, she turned and walked away. Seeing this, Bao Yu felt a deep sense of loss and stood dazed for a long while, dejected and listless. He then returned to the Yihong Courtyard. That night, he did not sleep at all—a restless night filled with unease. The next day, he barely managed to eat; his body burned with fever. His illness, compounded by the recent humiliations, the distress of the garden searches, the dismissals of Si Qi and Yingchun, and the sorrow over Qingwen—all combined with an external chill—soon worsened, and he fell ill, confined to his bed. Grandmother Jia, upon hearing this, visited him daily. Madame Wang inwardly rued having been so harsh with Qingwen. Though her heart was heavy, her countenance remained impassive as she ordered the maidservants to attend to him diligently. Twice a day a physician was summoned to take his pulse and prescribe medicine. After about a month, Bao Yu gradually recovered. Only after a careful period of over a hundred days was he permitted to partake of richer foods and venture out again; during that time no one was allowed at the gate, and all amusements were confined indoors. Fifty days later, his condition deteriorated so greatly that it became unbearable. Despite various attempts, Grandmother Jia and Madame Wang insisted on maintaining strict discipline, leaving him little choice. Consequently, he was left to the unrestrained antics of the maidservants, who engaged in all manner of mischief—acts that had never been seen before. (The details need not be recounted further.)  Meanwhile, Xiangling, since the day she had boldly cornered Bao Yu, began to fear his advances and resolved henceforth to avoid him. Consequently, she rarely entered the Grand View Garden, and each day she was in a hurry. Xue Pan, having recently married, found that with his protective talisman the burdens on him were somewhat eased, and his life became comparatively quieter; moreover, he recognized that his new wife was a talented and refined beauty, naturally dignified and graceful. Her anticipation for the day when she would officially become his wife was ten times greater than Xue Pan’s own eagerness. At long last, on the appointed day, he became exceedingly attentive and careful in his service. It turned out that the Xia family’s young miss, now seventeen, was both attractive and had learned a few characters. In matters of inner sentiment and temperament, she seemed to follow in the footsteps of Xiangfeng. However, having lost her father at an early age and being the sole beloved daughter under a doting and overindulgent mother, she had unfortunately developed a rakish nature, regarding herself as a goddess while regarding others as naught. At home she would quarrel with the maidservants, curse and be struck. Later, after leaving the house, she was expected to manage the household herself—no longer the demure girl she once was. Upon seeing that Xue Pan’s aura was gradually diminishing, she began to assert herself. At first, she merely dominated Xue Pan, but later, by fawning and flirting, she even managed to win over Madame Wang; eventually, even Miss Bao would take note. Miss Bao, having long observed her scheming nature, often skillfully countered her words with subtle retorts. Knowing she could not be defied, Jin Gui (as she was called) resolved to seek an opportunity to humble her—but found no occasion to do so, and was forced to comply. One day, with nothing pressing to do, Jin Gui chatted casually with Xiangling and inquired about Xiangling’s family background. When Xiangling replied “I have forgotten,” Jin Gui became displeased and claimed she was deliberately deceiving him. “Who gave you the name ‘Xiangling’?” he demanded.
Who would have thought she would change so?!”  Madame Wang laughed and replied, “The ones chosen by our venerable grandmother were indeed fine—but fate has not been kind to her, so she has contracted this ailment. As the old saying goes, ‘A woman changes as she grows older.’ Moreover, those with talent inevitably tend to become a bit wayward; our grandmother has experienced much in her time.”  “Three years ago I kept an eye on this matter and quietly chose her at first,” continued Madame Wang. “I observed that she was more attractive than others, though not very mature. In general, it is better to have someone like Xi Ren first. Although a virtuous wife or a beautiful concubine should be gentle and composed, Xi Ren’s appearance—though second to Qingwen’s—would be considered first-rate in a household. Furthermore, she is unassuming and honest in her conduct; for years she has never joined Bao Yu in his mischief. When Bao Yu acts the fool, she merely urges him sternly. Thus, after two years of careful selection, everything was satisfactory. I secretly set aside Qingwen’s monthly allowance and allocated two taels of silver from my own funds for her—just so that she might know to be extra careful and perform well. And I made no mention of it publicly; partly because Bao Yu is still young and if our elders were to learn of it, they might worry about his studies, and partly because Bao Yu, being so self-assured with his own circle, would not be willing to be corrected.”  After a long pause, Grandmother Jia smiled and said, “I see. That is all very well. Xi Ren, who was once so taciturn, has been called ‘the mute gourd.’ Since you know her well, there is no great error here.”  Madame Wang then recounted how today Jia Zheng had praised the matter and taken them out on a tour. Grandmother Jia listened and grew even more pleased. At that moment, Yingchun arrived dressed up to bid farewell and head out. Miss Feng also came by to offer morning greetings and to help serve breakfast. After a short round of banter, Grandmother Jia rested for a while. Then Madame Wang called Miss Feng and asked if the new medicinal pills had been prepared. Miss Feng replied, “Not yet—for now we are still taking decoctions. Rest assured, madame, I am on the mend.”  Seeing his spirit renewed, Madame Wang took heart and then mentioned the matter of dismissing Qingwen and the other girls. “Why did Bao Yu’s maid leave home without permission? You all must not be aware. Just the other day I checked along the way—who would have thought that even the newly arrived maid from Lan’s family was so coquettish and did not like him? I told her, ‘Give her to your eldest sister,’ so that each may depart on her own. When I asked your eldest sister, ‘Don’t you know Bao Yu’s maid has left?’ she said she had been informed and that in two or three days, when Auntie’s illness subsides, she will return. In truth, her ailment is nothing serious—just a cough and sore waist every year. Surely she must have left for a reason; has someone offended her? That child is stubborn, and in a household of relatives one must be careful not to offend others, or else things will turn sour.”  Miss Feng laughed and asked, “Who can truly afford to offend her?”  Madame Wang said, “Perhaps Bao Yu himself, who has always had no filter when he speaks; he never hesitates to blurt out whatever comes to mind.”  Miss Feng laughed, “Madame, you are worrying too much. If he were to go out and conduct himself properly, he would appear foolish; yet if he stays in the presence of these sisters and even the younger maidservants, he may inadvertently offend someone. I believe that sister Xue’s departure must be due to the recent search among the maidservants; naturally she does not trust the people in the garden and, being kin, has a maid at home to look after her. It is best that she avoid suspicion.”  Madame Wang replied, “You speak wisely. Now, go and tell the people outside to select the best ginseng and exchange it for two taels. If Grandmother asks, just say it is from Grandmother’s own supply – no need to elaborate.”  When Zhou Ruijia was about to leave, Miss Bao, who had been seated, laughed and said, “Madame, please hold on.
Everyone remarked that it was due to her suppressed anger. After two days, unexpectedly, someone discovered a paper effigy hidden among Jin Gui’s pillows – bearing her age and an inscription of eight characters, with five needles pinned into her heart area and the gaps between her ribs and limbs. Thus the household took this as news and reported it first to Aunt Xue. Aunt Xue, now frantic, and Xue Pan, even more disordered, threatened to interrogate everyone. Jin Gui said, “There is no need to wrong innocent people. It appears that Baochan’s ‘demon-repelling charm’ must be used.” Xue Pan replied, “But she has not spent much time in your room lately; why cling to a good woman?” Jin Gui sneered, “Who else is there? Am I not the only one? Even if there were others, who would dare enter my room?” Xue Pan said, “Now that Qiu Ling follows you every day, she surely knows; question her and you will find out.” Jin Gui laughed coldly, “Question whom? Who will confess? In my view, they will all feign ignorance—so let it drop. Besides, even if I were to be punished to death, it matters little; I could always remarry someone better. Truly, if you complain, who will not blame me?” Bursting into tears, she continued, “Then why must you drag everyone into this? I fear I will be blamed if you persist.” Xue Pan’s anger mounted, and he snatched up a door bolt, stormed off, and without further ado confronted Qiu Ling, accusing her directly. Qiu Ling cried out in protest. Aunt Xue rushed in and commanded, “Do not start beating before you understand the whole story! This maidservant has served for years—was it not that she was careless once? Would you really do something so heartless? Ask clearly first, then act!” Hearing his mother’s words, Jin Gui feared Xue Pan might soften, and she began to cry bitterly, “For half a month you have monopolized my Baochan, kept her from entering my room, and only allowed Qiu Ling to sleep with me. I wish to question Baochan, yet you continue protecting him. Now you act so defiantly as to beat her—if you kill me, then go ahead and remarry someone better; why must you put on this show?” Xue Pan’s anger grew even more. Aunt Xue, seeing how his daughter-in-law was oppressing her son, cursed bitterly. In her fury she ordered, “Sell Xiangling immediately!” Miss Bao then laughed, “Our family only knows how to buy, not sell—madam, you are all confused. If word gets out, won’t it be a laughingstock? If my elder brother and sister-in-law despise her and leave her to me, I’m doomed!” Aunt Xue replied, “Better to dismiss her entirely than let her remain with us.” Miss Bao laughed, “Whether she stays with me or not makes no difference—cut her off as if she were sold.” Xiangling had already run up to Aunt Xue, pleading bitterly and crying, unwilling to leave; she wished instead to remain with the young lady. Aunt Xue, with no alternative, had to relent. Thereafter, Xiangling indeed left with Miss Bao, effectively severing her previous ties. Yet she could not help but feel sorrow under the moonlight, and by lamplight she lamented quietly. Although she had spent several years in Xue Pan’s household, her delicate condition – compounded by her inherent illness – meant she never bore children; now, further agitated by anger and emotional strain, her health declined, and she eventually developed a “dry blood” disorder, growing thinner and losing her appetite, with no remedy proving effective. At that time, Jin Gui repeatedly quarreled with Xue Pan. On occasion, bolstered by wine, Xue Pan would even confront her twice. When he attempted to strike with a stick, Jin Gui evaded and ordered him away. When he nearly drew a knife to kill, she stretched out her neck defiantly. Xue Pan, unable to bring himself to strike her, raged for a while before giving up. Over time this became habitual, and it even led Jin Gui to increasingly insult Baochan. Baochan, who could not compare with Xiangling, was like dry tinder; having bonded with Xue Pan through shared feelings, he completely disregarded Jin Gui. Enraged by Jin Gui’s continual mistreatment, Baochan refused to back down.
Jia Zheng then asked, “Has Ying’er returned? How is she faring at the Sun family?” Madame Wang replied, “Young Ying has been weeping bitterly, saying that Uncle Sun is terribly fierce.” She then recounted Ying’er’s story. Jia Zheng sighed, “I knew it was not right, but Grandfather has already decided that there is nothing I can do. Ying’er must endure some grievances.” Madame Wang said, “But she is a new bride; we only hope that she will eventually thrive.” Laughing, Jia Zheng said, “What are you laughing about?” Madame Wang recounted Bao Yu’s words humorously. Jia Zheng couldn’t help but laugh and then said, “Speaking of Bao Yu, I recall something. This child, kept roaming the garden, is not doing well. If a daughter is unproductive, it is trivial; but if she is productive, it matters greatly. Recently, someone mentioned a certain gentleman from the south—a man of learning and exemplary character. I think that gentleman is very gentle. Our city children, though clever, are impetuous; if such a gentleman continues to act foolishly, it would be a waste. That is why our elders have refused to hire an external teacher, preferring instead to choose someone from within the family with some experience to teach the children. Now, although our venerable master’s scholarship is only average, he still manages to keep these young ones in check, so that they do not waste their lives.” Jia Zheng said, “Indeed; for now we only require that Bao Yu study—recite, compose essays. If he refuses to learn, then let our master discipline him so that he is not all talk and no substance, squandering his life.” After speaking, he stood, bowed, exchanged a few trivial words, and then took his leave. At the door he said, “Grandmother sends her regards; please convey my greetings.” Jia Zheng nodded and then boarded his carriage. Grandmaster Dai then returned inside and saw Bao Yu in the southwest corner by the window, where he had set up a small rosewood table, with two sets of old books piled beside it, and a slim volume of essays. All the stationery was tucked away in a drawer. Grandmaster Dai said, “Bao Yu, I heard you were ill the other day. Are you much better now?” Bao Yu stood and said, “I am much better.” Grandmaster Dai said, “Then you should really apply yourself. Your father expects you to become a proper adult and build a respectable career. Currently, you merely fool around with your sisters. Even if you recite a few lines of poetry, it is mere drivel; and even if you succeed, it is as fleeting as wind and moonlight, bearing no relation to the true work of life.” Bao Yu meekly replied, “Yes.” When he resumed his seat, he glanced around and saw that in former times several members of the Jin Rong family were missing, but now there were a few new young students—though rather coarse in manners. Suddenly he recalled Qin Zhong; now there was no one to accompany him or share confidences. His heart sank with sorrow, yet he dared not speak and simply continued reading silently. Grandmaster Dai then said to Bao Yu, “Today, for the first time, I will let you go home early. Tomorrow, you are to recite a chapter at the family school for me so I can assess your progress. I wish to know how much you have advanced.” This made Bao Yu’s heart race wildly. (…To be continued in the next installment.) Chapter 82: The Old Scholar’s Lecture Warns the Wayward, While a Sick Soul in Xiuxiang Is Troubled by a Terrible Nightmare  After Bao Yu returned from school, he went to see Grandmother Jia. Grandmother Jia smiled and said, “That wild horse has finally been bridled. Now go, pay your respects to your father and then disperse for a while.” Bao Yu readily agreed and went to see Jia Zheng. Jia Zheng asked, “Have you finished school early today? Has your teacher set your daily assignments?” Bao Yu replied, “Yes—every morning I review my books, after meals I write, and at noon I recite and study essays.” Nodding, Jia Zheng said, “Then off you go; also, go spend some time with Grandmother.
Ping’er laughed, “Our Mistress says you are extraordinarily refined, Miss!” Xiuyan replied modestly, “I am merely indifferent.” Ping’er continued, “But our Mistress remarked, ‘If the girl does not accept these garments, it means she either finds them too old or looks down upon our Mistress.’ She said that when she offered them back, she wouldn’t accept them.” Xiuyan blushed and said, “Then I dare not refuse.” They exchanged tea and continued. At Madam Xue’s residence, turmoil reigned as Jin Gui’s antics had stirred the household. When the old woman returned and mentioned Xiuyan’s lost garment, both Baochai and her mother wept bitterly. Baochai lamented, “It is all because our brother is absent that Miss Xing must bear extra hardship. We are fortunate that Sister Feng is so capable; we must remain vigilant—after all, they are all our kin.” Just then, Xue Ke entered and declared, “Our elder brother, during his years abroad, has consorted with naught but scoundrels! Not one upright man among them—all are like a pack of foxes and dogs! I’ve already driven them out these past few days, and henceforth I forbid any such people from entering!” Madam Xue sighed, “Even though I have a son, it now feels as if I have none. Even if the authorities approve, he is a failure. You, my nephew, are wiser than your elder brother—I now place my hopes in you. Learn well from now on. Moreover, the daughter-in-law you have taken does not compare to what we had before. A girl’s marriage is never easy; if a husband is capable, then she will have a future. But if Miss Xing turns out to be like this…” She trailed off, gesturing inwardly, “I need not say more. Miss Xing indeed possesses both modest means and self-respect. Once our affairs are settled, and you complete your proper tasks, I too shall have one less worry.” Xue Ke replied, “Sister, the matter of the Qin-sister’s departure has been a great worry for the Mistress. As for that matter—what is there to be said?” They spoke idly for a while. Then Xue Ke returned to his room. After dinner, he recalled that Xiuyan—now residing in the Jia Garden—is a poor orphan forced to rely on others, barely managing her daily needs. Knowing her well from the day she arrived, with her appearance and character fully understood, he could only sigh over fate’s injustice: how is it that one like the affluent and pampered Xia Jingui is so fortunate, while Xiuyan must suffer? He mused bitterly on how the King of Hell might have judged them. Overwhelmed with melancholy, he attempted to compose a poem to vent his sorrow:    “Like a dragon deprived of water, a fish left to dry,   Two hearts, each in their separate lands, suffer in solitude. Together in the mire we endure endless hardships—   Who knows when we shall reach the realm of emptiness?”  Finishing his verse, he considered pasting it on the wall, but feeling too embarrassed to be ridiculed, he tucked it into his book instead. He then brooded on his advancing years and the calamities that had struck his family, lamenting that with every misfortune, the fragile state of his inner world became ever more desolate. At that moment, Baocan reappeared carrying a small box. With a cheerful smile, he set it on the table. Xue Ke invited him to sit. Baocan said, “These are four plates of assorted fruits and a small jug of wine—delivered by the Mistress for Second Master.” Xue Ke replied with a courteous smile, “The Mistress has truly been thoughtful. But why did she have the little maids deliver them personally? What prompted such extra effort?” Baocan replied, “You see, among our own, there is no need for Second Master to engage in such formalities. Moreover, given our elder brother’s troublesome ways, the Mistress has long wished to send something in gratitude—but she fears that if people talk, suspicions will arise. In our family, giving gifts is simply a matter of goodwill and won’t invite gossip.” Xue Ke said, “Keep the fruits; as for the wine, let the Mistress take it back. I have little use for my wine now—one cannot indulge without reason.
Tomorrow there will be more people sent; rest assured.” Si Qi, unable to help but weep, kowtowed to Yingchun and bid farewell to everyone. Then she whispered to Yingchun, “Even if you try to plead my case, please at least speak on my behalf—just a small favor.” Yingchun replied tearfully, “Rest assured.” Thus, Zhou Ruijia and his companions took Si Qi away. Two old women then gathered all of Si Qi’s belongings and handed them to her. After only a few steps, they encountered Xiu Ju, who was already wiping away tears. He handed Si Qi a small silk pouch and said, “This is from your sister – a token of our shared bond. Since we must eventually part, take it as a memento.” Si Qi accepted it and burst into further tears, crying together with Xiu Ju. Impatient, Zhou Ruijia urged, and the two finally dispersed. Si Qi, still sobbing, pleaded, “Dear aunts, please show some compassion and let me go, so I may bid farewell to my dearest friend. We have been so close for all these years.” Zhou Ruijia and his companions, each busy with their own tasks, said scornfully, “I advise you to leave; stop dithering! We have important matters to attend to. Who do you think you are, crawling out from your own garment? Why must you say farewell? You’ll only delay for a while—does that matter?” Irritated, he said, “Hurry up and go!” As he spoke, he led her out the back corner gate. Unable to protest further, Si Qi followed. Just then, Bao Yu, returning from outside, saw Si Qi being led away with many belongings. Suspecting that she was being sent off for good, he hurried over and asked, “Where are you going?” Zhou Ruijia and the others, well aware of Bao Yu’s past behavior and fearing that prying might cause further trouble, laughed and said, “None of your business—hurry and study!” Bao Yu, laughing nervously, said, “Sisters, please wait a moment—I have something to say.” Zhou Ruijia retorted, “Madame has ordered that you must not waste any time. What reason could you possibly have? We only know what Madame says and cannot meddle further.” Si Qi, upon seeing Bao Yu, clutched his hand and cried, “What have you done to me? Please, tell me—please, I beg you!” Bao Yu, with tears streaming down his face, said, “I do not know what terrible deed you have committed! Qingwen is so ill, and now you are about to leave—what shall we do?” Growing impatient, Zhou Ruijia said to Si Qi, “If you do not behave as a proper lady, I will beat you. Do not think that your former privileges will save you now! Even if you must be noisy for a short while, that is inevitable!” Before long, several women seized Si Qi and dragged her away. Bao Yu, fearing they might blab everything, glared after them until they were out of sight, muttering bitterly, “How strange—once a woman is married and carries the scent of a man, she becomes so unprincipled, even more so than a man!” An old gatekeeper overheard and asked with a laugh, “So you say that all daughters are virtuous, but every married woman is wicked?” Bao Yu fumed, “Yes, indeed!” Just then, several old women entered and said, “Everyone, be alert and serve properly. At this moment, Madame herself is coming out to inspect the garden.” They then ordered, “Quickly call the people from Yihong Courtyard to meet her at the door and escort her out.” Amused, they added, “Ah, Amitabha! Today, once the heavens open their eyes and send this troublesome imp away, everyone will be at peace.” Bao Yu, upon hearing that Madame Wang was coming for a thorough search, was sure that even Qingwen would not be spared, and hastily fled—but later, as he mumbled his resentful words, he heard nothing further. Later that night at dawn, a little maid from Madame Wang’s room opened the front corner door and announced Madame Wang’s orders: “Immediately rouse Bao Yu; wash your face and change your clothes. Today someone has invited the master to admire the autumn chrysanthemums.
