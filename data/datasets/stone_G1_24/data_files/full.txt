Chapter 1
Zhen Shiyin Discerns the Wondrous Through a Dreamlike Vision;
Jia Yucun, Amid the Dust, Longs for a Refined Maiden

This is the very first chapter of the volume.

The author says he once had a dreamlike experience and therefore concealed the true events, instead employing a miraculous tale to compose this Story of the Stone. Hence he speaks of “Zhen Shiyin,” and so on. Yet what events and which persons are described here? He also says:

“Now, the world is filled with bustling dust and I have accomplished nothing. I suddenly recall the young women of those former days and examine each of them carefully, realizing that in conduct and perception they all surpass me.
I, though a man of stature, truly cannot compare to those ladies. I am more than ashamed, yet regret is of no use—there is nothing further to be done.
Today, I wish to compile a volume and inform the world of my guilt: relying on heavenly fortune and the virtue of my ancestors, enjoying fine clothes and plentiful feasts, yet repaying neither the upbringing of my father and brothers nor the guidance of teachers and friends, so that I have ended up with no skill whatsoever, leading half a life of destitution. I know my transgressions are many, yet there were clearly excellent women in the boudoirs. One must not, simply because of my unworthiness, hide my own shortcomings and obliterate all of them together.
Thus, a hut of thatch and narrow beams, a cord bed and clay stove, are no hindrance to my state of mind—let alone the morning breeze and evening moon, the willows by the steps, or flowers in the courtyard, which only inspire writing. Though I am unlearned and inarticulate, what harm in employing rustic words, weaving them into a narrative, so that the stories of the boudoirs may be widely known? It can also dispel a moment’s gloom and awaken the eyes of my peers. Would not that be fitting?”
Therefore, he mentions “Jia Yucun.” Moreover, throughout the chapter, he employs words such as “dream” and “illusion,” which indeed convey the main intent of this book and serve as a reminder to readers.

You, dear reader, may ask: from where does this story begin? Though it sounds rather fantastic, on closer examination it proves most intriguing.

In ancient times, when the goddess Nüwa was melting stones to mend the sky, upon Mount Da Huang and the Wuji Cliff she refined 36,501 great stones, each measuring twelve zhang in height and twenty-four zhang in width. The goddess used exactly 36,500 of them to repair the sky, leaving behind a single stone unused and discarding it at the foot of Qinggeng Peak. Who could have guessed that after refinement this stone had become spiritually aware, able to come and go at will, capable of enlarging or shrinking in size? Seeing that all the other stones had been chosen to mend the sky while it alone, lacking any special merit, was left out, the stone lamented its fate day and night in sorrow.

One day, as it grieved and sighed, it spotted in the distance a monk and a Daoist approaching, both of extraordinary bearing, elegant and unusual in appearance. Arriving at Qinggeng Peak, they sat on the ground talking. Noticing this stone, now reduced to the size of a fan pendant, crystal clear and lustrous, the monk lifted it in his palm, smiling: “You do have a remarkable form, yet lack any real purpose. We must carve a few words on you so that all who see you will know you are something strange and wonderful. Then we shall take you to a land thriving and illustrious, a place of poetic and courteous families, flourishing with flowers and willows, abundant with softness and riches—so you may see the world for yourself.” The stone was overjoyed and asked: “Pray tell, which words will you engrave upon me, and where shall we go?” The monk replied with a laugh: “Ask no more. In days to come, it shall all become clear.” With that, he tucked the stone into his sleeve, then, together with the Daoist, drifted away. None knew where they went.

Countless ages and cycles passed. One day, an itinerant named Kongkong Daoren, seeking the Way and the path to immortality, happened by Qinggeng Peak beneath the Great Wasteland Mountain and Wuji Cliff. Suddenly he spotted a large stone on which words were plainly engraved, describing everything in full detail. Taking it up from the beginning, he saw it was the very stubborn stone that had no talent to repair the heavens, manifested in human form, carried off into the mortal world by the Vast and Boundless Adept and the Distant and Profound True Man, and guided to the opposite shore. On its surface were accounts of a fallen realm, the place of rebirth, various household trifles, inner-chamber sentiments, poetry, riddles—everything was there. Only the historical era and dates were missing. At the end, another quatrain appeared:

To mend the azure sky, I had no skill;
In vain was I cast down into the dusty world for so many years.
This records affairs before and after my life—
But who can preserve them as a curious tale?
After reading for a time, Kongkong Daoren realized the stone had a story behind it. So he addressed the stone: “Stone Brother, your tale, as you yourself narrate it, indeed seems intriguing. You’ve engraved these words, hoping to spread it as a legendary account. But to my mind, for one thing, there is no era or date to verify; and for another, there are no great and loyal heroes reforming the court or improving social customs—just a handful of unusual girls, driven by affection or infatuation, displaying small talents and modest virtues. Even if I copy it down, it can hardly be considered a remarkable work.” The stone replied: “Master, why be so naive? Through the ages, so-called unofficial histories borrow nothing but the trappings of Han or Tang. My stone-record follows no such pattern, merely its own logic and truths, thus it feels fresh and unique. Moreover, those unofficial histories often vilify rulers and ministers or slander wives and daughters with adultery and evil beyond count. Others write in the vein of boudoir romances, filled with obscene filth that corrupts young readers most easily. As for so-called ‘talented scholars and beautiful ladies,’ their texts are riddled with references to Wenjun (the lady who eloped with the poet Sima Xiangru) or endless praise of Zijian, with thousands of pages reciting the same tune—one cannot avoid resorting to debauchery. Most authors just want to insert their own lovelorn poems or erotic verses, so they invent a pair of lovers’ names, then add a scheming villain—rather like the clown in a play. Even more tiresome is the pretentious classical style: full of meaningless phrases, inconsistent and lacking any fidelity to real sentiments.

My account spans half a lifetime of things I personally saw and heard. I do not boast that these women outshine those of the past, yet noting their deeds and origins can at least relieve one’s gloom. As for the few odd poems, they might provide a laugh over a meal or a drink. The joys and sorrows, ups and downs—each follows its own trace, without forced invention that might distort the truth. I merely wish that people, in their idle moments of drunken leisure or in times of trouble when they seek respite, might take this up for amusement, not only finding it refreshing but also sparing themselves some wasted time. Then they might avoid pursuing vain illusions. What say you, Master?”
Kongkong Daoren considered this for a while, then reread The Story of the Stone. Seeing that its main theme was love, and that it simply recorded events without urging sedition or arousing lust, he carefully copied it from start to finish for the world to hear. From that time on, having glimpsed color and form, the Daoist, moved by emotion, realized the emptiness of desire through contemplating its form, and changed his name to “Qing Seng”—the Passionate Monk. He changed The Story of the Stone to The Passionate Monk’s Record. Kong Meixi of Donglu titled it The Mirror of Love and Beauty. Later, Cao Xueqin, sequestered in the “Studio of Mourning Red,” labored over it for ten years, revising it five times, organizing the contents into a table of chapters and dividing it into sections, also bestowing another title, Twelve Beauties of Jinling, and adding this quatrain, thus completing the origin story of The Story of the Stone:
All a mass of absurd words, awash with bitter tears.
All say the author is mad—who truly grasps his meaning?
Now that the work’s origins are clarified, we still do not know which people or events were recorded on that stone. Dear reader, please attend.

The stone itself says: in those days the earth collapsed to the southeast, and in that southeast region lay the city of Gusu; within the city, the Gate of Chang was one of the top spots for wealth and romance in the dusty world. Outside that gate stretched Ten-Mile Street, which contained Renqing Lane. Inside that lane stood an ancient temple, so narrow that folks called it the “Gourd Temple.” Next to the temple lived a local gentleman of leisure named Zhen Fei, styled “Shiyin.” His principal wife was Lady Feng—virtuous in temperament and deeply versed in propriety and etiquette. Although not particularly rich, they were considered a prominent family in that place. Zhen Shiyin himself was by nature peaceful, never pursuing fame or rank, passing each day by admiring flowers, planting bamboo, sampling wine, and composing poetry, like one of the immortals. He had but one shortcoming: already past fifty, he had no son, only a three-year-old daughter called Yinglian.

One day, in the sultry, endless midday heat, Shiyin sat idly in his study. Growing weary of reading, he put his book aside, rested his head on the desk, and dozed off. In a half-dream, he seemed to roam in an unknown place. Suddenly, from over there, he saw a monk and a Daoist walking and chatting together. He heard the Daoist ask, “Having taken that object in hand, where do you intend to go?” The monk smiled: “Do not fret. There’s a certain matter of earthly romance that must be settled. A whole flock of predestined lovers have yet to be born into the human realm. This is the right chance to include that object among them and let it experience life.” The Daoist asked, “So more predestined lovers are about to descend and endure mortal existence. But where will they begin, and where will they end?” The monk replied, “It’s rather amusing. Once upon a time, that stone, unused by the goddess, was free to wander everywhere. One day it arrived at the palace of Fairy Jinghuan (Disenchantment). Perceiving its background, she kept it in the Crimson Mist Palace and named it the Divine Attendant of the Crimson Mist. Often it roamed the bank of the Western River of Souls, where it found a crimson pearl-like celestial plant. Enchanted by its delicate loveliness, it watered it daily with sweet dew, enabling that plant to extend its life indefinitely. Then, nourished by the essence of heaven and earth—and further by sweet dew—it escaped the husk of flora, transforming into a female figure, wandering about the Heaven of Unfulfilled Yearnings, feeding on secret fruit when hungry and drinking water of vexation when thirsty. Because she had not repaid the favor of its irrigation, a deep, inextricable fondness swelled within her heart. She would often say: ‘I received the gift of his dew but have no water of my own to repay him. If he descends to the mortal realm, I shall follow and walk that path, and repay him with all my life’s tears—thus settling the debt.’ So it is that countless predestined lovers must descend into the mortal world, and the Crimson Pearl Fairy Grass is among them. Today that stone should go down as well, so I am specially taking it to Fairy Jinghuan, who will give it a record number. It shall accompany these spirits of passion down into the mortal realm, settling this karmic case.” The Daoist answered, “Indeed, how odd. Who ever heard of a ‘repayment in tears’? Why don’t we too descend, to redeem a few souls? Wouldn’t that be an act of merit?” The monk said, “That aligns with my plan. Come along then to Fairy Jinghuan’s palace so we can hand over this blockhead, set up the proper records for these star-crossed lovers, and later we can descend as well. Right now, half of them have entered the mundane realm, though not yet the entire group.” The Daoist said, “So be it. I shall follow you.”

Shiyin heard all this quite clearly and could not help stepping forward to greet them with a bow, smiling: “Revered immortals, greetings!” The monk and the Daoist promptly returned his courtesy. Shiyin said, “I heard your discourse on karma just now, something rarely spoken of in this world. But I am slow-witted and cannot fully grasp its meaning. If only you would enlighten me, so that I might take it to heart and thus avoid the miseries of sinking into worldly confusion.” The two immortals smiled: “This is a cosmic secret we cannot reveal in advance. When the time comes, you need only remember us, and you will be able to escape the pit of fire.” Shiyin, seeing they would say no more, did not press them. Smiling, he said: “Then this secret must not be disclosed. But you just spoke of a ‘blockhead.’ Might I at least see what that might be?” The monk replied, “If you ask about that object, you may indeed have one glimpse.”

So saying, he presented it to Shiyin. Taking it, Shiyin saw it was a bright, lustrous piece of beautiful jade. Upon it, in clear script, were the words “Precious Jade of Spiritual Understanding,” with lines of smaller characters on the back. He was about to read them in detail when the monk exclaimed, “We have arrived at the realm of illusion!” He snatched it away from Shiyin, and, with the Daoist, they passed under a towering stone arch inscribed with four great words: “The Land of Illusion.” A couplet flanked either side:

When the sham passes for real, the real becomes sham;
Where nothing exists, something arises, and where something arises, nothing exists again.
Shiyin was eager to follow them, and as he lifted his foot, he heard a deafening crash like thunder, as if mountains were crumbling and the ground splitting asunder. Shiyin cried out and opened his eyes; the blazing sun beat down, banana leaves drifted in the heat, and half his dream was already forgotten. Just then he saw the nurse coming with little Yinglian. Noticing his daughter, so delicate in form, like carved jade, he took her in his arms, playing with her for a moment. Then he carried her out to the front of the street to enjoy the bustle of festival festivities. He was about to go back when he noticed a monk and a Daoist approaching. The monk’s head was scabby, the Daoist’s hair disheveled, and both seemed mad, laughing and chattering as they came closer. On seeing Shiyin holding Yinglian, the monk wept loudly and exclaimed, “Benefactor, why do you cradle in your arms this thing of ill fate, which will only bring calamity upon its parents?” Shiyin, perceiving nonsense, paid no heed. The monk continued: “Hand her over to me! Hand her over!” Shiyin grew impatient, turned to go indoors, and the monk pointed and laughed uproariously, chanting four lines:

You raise a pampered child—how foolish you are!
A face once fair as a lily may melt away like snow.
Take care after the Lantern Festival’s bright cheer;
Smoke and ash may follow soon enough.
Shiyin heard him, felt uneasy, and wanted to question him further. But the Daoist said, “There’s no need for us to travel together. Let us part ways now, each to our own business. In three kalpas, I’ll wait for you at Mount Beimang. Once we are all gathered, we will return to the Land of Illusion to finalize our records.” The monk replied, “Splendid, splendid!” With that, they vanished, leaving no trace.

Inwardly, Shiyin thought, “Those two must be extraordinary. I ought to have inquired about them, but now it is too late.” As he stood pondering, a poor scholar named Jia Hua—styled Shifei, nicknamed Yucun—who was lodging at the Gourd Temple next door, happened to come by. A native of Huzhou, he was from a family of scholar-officials that had fallen on hard times in this decadent age, leaving only him alive. Unable to find support in his hometown, he had come to the capital hoping for a post, but was stranded here, lodging at the temple, eking out a living by selling his calligraphy and essays. He and Shiyin had grown acquainted. So, seeing Shiyin, Jia Yucun bowed and smiled: “Sir, you stand at the door as if you await some news from the street.” Shiyin answered, “Not at all. I only brought my little girl out to amuse her, for I am idle indeed. You arrive at a perfect time—please come into my study. We can both while away the long day.” He handed his daughter back inside, then led Yucun into his library. A servant boy served tea. They had scarcely exchanged a few words when a household retainer came running to announce, “Master Yan is here to call.” Shiyin hurriedly got up and said to Yucun, “Forgive me for leaving you like this; please wait a bit.” Yucun rose and insisted, “Sir, please see to your guest. I am often here—I shall wait.” With that, Shiyin went to the front hall.

Left alone, Yucun entertained himself by leafing through the poetry books. Suddenly, he heard a soft cough outside the window. Rising to peer out, he saw a maid picking flowers, her features delicate and refined, her eyebrows gently curved—though perhaps not of the highest beauty, there was a certain charm about her. Yucun gazed spellbound. The maid, after plucking a flower, was about to leave when she glanced up and noticed a stranger with disheveled garb and patched clothes, but whose physique was sturdy—broad shoulders, starry eyes, a firm jaw. Startled, she turned away, yet quickly cast another backward glance. Observing her glance, Yucun thought she might harbor some feeling for him, causing him indescribable delight. He imagined her to be a keen-eyed soul in a dusty world, a rare confidante. Shortly after, a serving boy came in, reminding him that there was company in the front, so he left quietly. Once Shiyin’s visitor departed and he realized Yucun had gone, Shiyin chose not to call him back.

In time, Mid-Autumn Festival arrived. After his family’s celebration, Shiyin prepared another table of food in his study and walked by moonlight to invite Yucun from the temple. Since that day he had glimpsed Zhen’s maid who turned twice to look at him, Yucun had thought of her constantly, fancying that she understood him. Now, with the festival upon him, he naturally felt a flood of sentiment. He composed a regulated verse of five characters per line:

My fate uncharted in three lifetimes,
Only adding to this sorrow now.
When vexed, I knit my brow;
When I depart, how oft I gaze back.
Beholding my form in moonlit winds,
Who could share the moonlight by my side?
If the moon cared, it would shine first
Upon that fair one’s hair.
He finished his poem, then recalled his life’s unfulfilled ambitions and how opportunity had not yet come. Sighing, he quoted another couplet aloud:

Jade lies in a box awaiting a worthy price;
An ornament rests in its case, awaiting the time to fly.
Shiyin arrived right at that moment and, hearing these words, laughed: “Brother Yucun, your grand aspirations are indeed remarkable!” Yucun returned the laugh: “Not at all. Merely echoing lines from old masters—no cause for praise.” Then he asked, “What brings you here, sir?” Shiyin replied, “Tonight is the Mid-Autumn Festival, often called the reunion feast. Knowing you are lodging in a monk’s cell must feel lonely. I have prepared a small meal to invite you to my study so we can celebrate together. Will you accept this humble offer?” Yucun did not refuse but smiled: “Given your kindness, how could I decline?” And so they crossed over to Shiyin’s study.

After tea was served, plates of fine dishes and good wine were laid out. The two men sat together, at first sipping slowly, conversing in a leisurely manner. Their mood grew ever more convivial, and soon they raised cups to one another. Outside, every household played woodwinds and strings; from each door came song and laughter. Above, the moon shone round and bright. Inspired by the scene, the two drank with unabashed fervor. As the wine worked upon him, Yucun felt a wild elation. He faced the moon, let his heart speak, and recited:

When the calendar reaches the fifteenth night, a perfect circle appears,
Its pure radiance embracing the jade parapet below.
Heaven lifts forth a single disc—just risen—
While countless mortals gaze upward everywhere.
Shiyin exclaimed, “Brilliant indeed! I have always believed you would never remain a man of low station. These lines you’ve uttered already portend ascension to the clouds in no time—my congratulations!” He personally filled a cup and offered it in celebration. Yucun drained it in one go but suddenly sighed: “I do not boast in my cups, but as for the learning of our times, I might passably hold my own. Yet the journey to the capital is far, and I have neither means nor resources to get there. Selling writing or calligraphy alone cannot suffice.” Shiyin cut him short: “Brother, why did you never mention this before? I have often wanted to help, but you never brought it up. Now that I know, though I am not especially capable, I at least recognize the difference between righteousness and profit. Next year is the great triennial exam. You must head to the capital soon, succeed in the spring examination, and fulfill your potential. As for travel expenses and such, allow me to bear them, for that would not be unworthy of our friendship.” He then summoned a servant, instructing him to fetch fifty taels of silver and two sets of winter garments. Turning back to Yucun, he added, “The nineteenth is an auspicious day. You can buy passage west, and once you soar high in success, we shall meet again in the winter—would that not be splendid?” Yucun accepted the silver and clothing with but a brief word of thanks and seemed entirely at ease, continuing to drink and joke as before. They drank on until the third watch of the night, then parted.

Shiyin saw Yucun off, returned to his room, and slept until the sun was already high. Remembering last night’s conversation, he intended to write two letters of recommendation for Yucun to take to the capital, to help him find a place among the influential there. He sent someone to invite Yucun over, but the servant returned saying, “The monk told me that Master Jia left for the capital at dawn. He also asked the monk to tell you: ‘For a scholar, there is no need to heed auspicious or inauspicious days—attending to the real matter is what counts. Pardon me for leaving without a proper farewell.’” Shiyin could only drop the matter.

Time flies swiftly in idleness, and soon the Lantern Festival arrived. Shiyin told a family servant, Huo Qi, to carry Yinglian out to watch the holiday fireworks and festivities. Around midnight, Huo Qi needed to relieve himself, so he set Yinglian down on someone’s threshold. By the time he was done, the child was gone. Panicking, he searched everywhere until dawn. Failing to find her, he dared not return but fled to parts unknown. Shiyin and his wife, having lost their only child, were distraught day and night. Grief overwhelmed them; their sorrow knew no bounds.

Within a month, Shiyin fell ill from worry; his wife, Madam Feng, also took ill from pining after their daughter. They sought doctors and diviners without success. Then, on the fifteenth day of the third month, a monk in the Gourd Temple was frying offerings when the oil spilled, igniting the paper windows. Houses here were built of bamboo and wood, and fate decreed it so, for the fire spread rapidly, devouring everything, so that the entire street became an inferno. Despite the efforts of soldiers and citizens to extinguish it, the flames had grown uncontrollable, burning fiercely through the night, and no one knows how many homes were lost. Their neighbor, the Zhen household, soon lay in charred ruins. Shiyin, his wife, and a few servants survived, but their residence was destroyed. He sighed in despair, discussing with his wife the idea of moving to their rural estate. However, recent years had brought drought and floods, with rebels everywhere. Soldiers were dispatched to suppress them, making it impossible to remain safely on the land. They had to sell off their fields, and, taking what little silver remained, they moved in with his father-in-law.

His father-in-law was named Feng Su, originally from Dayu Prefecture. Though a farmer, he had enough means to live comfortably. Seeing his daughter and son-in-law arrive in such wretched condition, he was none too pleased. Luckily, Shiyin still had some money from selling his land, and he asked Feng Su to help him buy a little house and land for future subsistence. Feng Su, mixing partial sincerity with profiteering, gave him a few acres of poor farmland and a rundown cottage. Shiyin, being a scholar, was unaccustomed to any business or farming. After a year or two of struggling, he became even poorer. Feng Su harbored constant resentment, complaining to others that Shiyin was useless and lazy, though Shiyin knew this already. The regrets of the previous year, the scares and outbursts of frustration, plus the sorrow of old age laid him low, and he began visibly to weaken, showing signs of departing this life.

One day, leaning on a staff, Shiyin staggered out to the street in hopes of lifting his spirits. Suddenly he saw a limping Daoist in tattered clothes, his hair wild, chanting these lines:

The world knows how fine immortality is, yet they cannot forget rank and fame.
Heroes and ministers, where are they now? Buried in tombs overgrown with weeds.
The world knows how fine immortality is, yet they cannot forget silver and gold.
All day they bemoan never having enough; by the time they have enough, their eyes are closed forever.
The world knows how fine immortality is, yet they cannot forget their lovely wives.
They speak of deep affection daily—then once the husband dies, the wife follows another.
The world knows how fine immortality is, yet they cannot forget their children.
Foolish parents abound through the ages; but where is the child who truly repays their kindness?
Hearing this, Shiyin came forward. “What are you babbling about, sir? All I hear is ‘fine, fine.’” The Daoist laughed: “If you have heard the word ‘fine,’ that is enlightenment. Know that in this world, ‘fine’ means ‘settled,’ and only once settled is it truly fine. If not settled, it is not fine; if you want it to be fine, let it be settled. I call this the ‘Song of Being Settled.’” Shiyin, having natural insight, upon hearing this, found his heart illuminated. He smiled: “Hold on—I should like to supply a commentary for your ‘Song of Being Settled.’” The Daoist replied, “Be my guest.” Shiyin then said:

In an empty hall, once there were mats piled high;
Now grass stands withered, yet once it was a place of dances and song.
Spiderwebs now lace the carved beams; green paper covers patched windows of thatch.
They prattle on about rosy cheeks and delicate fragrance—
How quickly hair turns gray at the temples!
Yesterday, white bones were buried beneath the loess—
Tonight, in crimson satin, a pair of lovers lies entwined.
Chests full of gold, coffers full of silver—
In an instant, found a beggar, cursed by all.
We lament that others perish young, never guessing we might return home to die ourselves.
We teach our children well—yet who can say they won’t become bullies?
We lavish them with the choicest food—only to see them drift into disrepute.
Because we thought an official cap was too small, we now bear shackles and stocks.
Pity the ragged coat of yesterday—today we loathe the unwieldy purple robe.
Chaos reigns: you sing, I enter the stage; one mistake, and we take a strange land for home.
How absurd it is, that in the end all is but a wedding garment tailored for someone else.
The crazy, limping Daoist clapped his hands and laughed: “You have explained it perfectly—truly perfectly!” Shiyin replied simply, “Let us be off.” He grabbed the bag slung over the Daoist’s shoulder and put it on his own, never returning home. He drifted away with the Daoist. The entire neighborhood was thrown into commotion, taking this as a strange tale. His wife, Madam Feng, upon hearing, wept until she nearly passed out. She and her father dispatched people everywhere to search, but no one heard a word of him. Alas, she was obliged to live with her parents. She still had two old maids from the Zhen household, and the three of them worked on needlework to help with the family’s expenses. Feng Su complained constantly, but there was little else he could do.

One day, the Zhen family’s head maid went out to buy thread. On the street, she heard the call “Make way for the new magistrate!” She stood at the door to watch and saw bailiffs in pairs marching ahead. Soon a sedan chair appeared, bearing an official in a black cap and crimson robe. She stared in astonishment, for he looked most familiar—where had she seen him before? Then she went back inside and set the thought aside. That evening, just as she was about to retire, there came a loud pounding at the door, and voices yelling that they were officers of the county magistrate, demanding someone for questioning! Feng Su was alarmed and stood agape.

What misfortune had come to pass? We must wait until the next chapter to learn more.
Chapter 2: Lady Jia Passes Away in Yangzhou; Leng Zixing Relates the Affairs of the Rong Mansion

Feng Su, hearing the constables banging at the door and calling for someone to appear, hastened out to greet them with a nervous smile. He asked what business they had, but they only shouted, “Quickly bring out Master Zhen!” Alarmed, Feng Su said, “I am named Feng, not Zhen. My son-in-law once bore the surname Zhen, but he left home to become a monk over a year ago. Is it he you wish to question?” The yamen runners replied, “We don’t know anything about ‘Zhen’ or ‘Fake.’ Since this man is your son-in-law, you can come along to make things clear before the magistrate.” Without further explanation, they bustled Feng Su away. Everyone in the Feng household was thrown into confusion, not knowing what had happened.

It was well past midnight when Feng Su finally returned. Anxiously, his family demanded to know the details. He explained, “The newly appointed magistrate is named Jia Hua, originally from Huzhou. He was acquainted with my son-in-law in the past. He spotted Jiao Xing, one of our maids, buying thread at our door and assumed that my son-in-law had moved here—so he came to summon us. Once I explained how things really stood, the magistrate grew thoughtful and sighed for a while. Then he asked after our granddaughter. I told him that we lost her during the lantern festival. He said, ‘No matter. I’ll send people to search thoroughly and be sure to bring her back.’ We spoke for a short time and, as I departed, he gave me two taels of silver.” Hearing this, Lady Zhen grew sad, and the night passed without further incident.

Early the next morning, someone arrived on Jia Yucun’s behalf, delivering two small packets of silver and four bolts of fine silk, all meant as gifts of thanks for Lady Zhen. There was also a private letter to Feng Su, asking him to propose that Lady Zhen allow the maid Jiao Xing to enter the magistrate’s household as a secondary wife. Overjoyed, Feng Su—who could scarcely wait to oblige the magistrate—enthusiastically pressed the matter upon his daughter. That very evening, they arranged a small sedan chair and sent Jiao Xing into the yamen. Jia Yucun was delighted, of course. He rewarded Feng Su with a hundred taels of silver and showered Lady Zhen with further gifts, urging her to use these means to get by until her daughter’s whereabouts could be found.

This Jiao Xing was, in fact, the very maid who had once turned to glance back at Jia Yucun. Who could have guessed that a single look would spark such an unexpected destiny? Fortune smiled upon her doubly; soon after she joined Jia Yucun, she bore him a son within a year. After another half-year, his principal wife fell ill and passed away, and Jia Yucun promoted Jiao Xing to become his wedded wife. Thus it is said:

A single backward glance,
And she rose above all others.
It turned out that, after Zhen Shiyin funded him long ago, Jia Yucun had set out on the sixteenth day of that month for the capital. At the imperial examinations, he excelled, became a successful graduate, and was posted to a minor official rank. By now, he had already risen to be magistrate of this very county. Although exceptionally capable, he was also somewhat avaricious and harsh, wielding his talent with contempt for superiors. His colleagues looked askance at him, and within a year, his higher-ups formally charged him with slyness and cunning. They also accused him of protecting corrupt clerks and currying favor with local gentry, which enraged the Emperor. An edict immediately stripped him of office. Once news of his dismissal arrived, every official in the prefecture rejoiced. Jia Yucun was mortified but showed not the slightest resentment, laughing the matter off as he completed the handover of his post. With the money he had accrued from his years in service, he arranged for his household to be resettled in his hometown. As for himself, he slung a bundle over his shoulder, donned traveling robes, and roamed the famous scenic spots of the empire in search of diversion.

Eventually, his wanderings brought him near Huai’an and Yangzhou. There he heard that the newly appointed Salt Commissioner was one Lin Ruhai. This Lin, courtesy name Ruhai, had been a top-ranked scholar (a “Tan-hua”) in an earlier set of examinations and had since risen to the post of Imperial Censor in the Lantai Court. He hailed from Gusu and had recently been commissioned as the imperial inspector for the salt trade. In fact, Lin Ruhai’s ancestors had once held a marquisate. Though the formal right of inheritance was only granted for three generations, an extra measure of imperial grace had extended it further, so that Ruhai’s father still held a hereditary title, and Ruhai himself then obtained official rank by passing the civil service exams. The Lin family, though ennobled by birth, was also steeped in scholarship. However, their branches were few, and though there existed some distant relatives in the same clan, the direct line remained scant. Lin Ruhai, already fifty, had only one son, who died at the age of three the previous year. He had several secondary wives, yet still no surviving children. Hence there was nothing he could do but regret his destiny. His principal wife, of the Jia family, had borne him one daughter, called Daiyu, then only five. The child, showing signs of a bright and graceful intelligence, was treasured like a precious jewel. Out of love and yearning, the couple hoped she might learn a few characters—if only to fill the quiet of their home.

At that time, Jia Yucun happened to be staying in a local inn, recovering from a bout of illness but beset by dwindling funds. He urgently needed somewhere quiet to rest. Two old acquaintances who knew the Salt Commissioner recommended him as a tutor for the commissioner’s young daughter. The girl was still very small, frail in constitution, and her daily lessons were set light and easy. Aside from two maids who studied alongside her, the demands were trivial, requiring little effort. Thus Jia Yucun had ample time to recuperate. Over a year passed in this way until tragedy befell the commissioner’s household: Lady Jia, Lin Ruhai’s principal wife and mother to the young girl, fell gravely ill and died. The girl Daiyu, in her mourning, faithfully served her mother’s sickbed and observed all the rites, exhausting her own delicate health. She relapsed into a lingering weakness and halted her lessons for quite some time. Yucun, now left with little to do, would take a stroll whenever the weather was fine.

One day, he ventured out to enjoy the rustic scenery of the countryside. Wandering aimlessly through a place of wooded hills, flowing streams, and dense stands of bamboo, he glimpsed a run-down temple whose entry gate was tilted and decrepit, its walls cracked and peeling. The signboard read “The Temple of Enlightened Wisdom,” while an old, tattered couplet on one side declared:

“Beyond death, enough remains—yet who withdraws his hand?
With no road before your eyes—might you at last turn back?”
Yucun marveled: “Though these words are very plain, the meaning is quite deep. I’ve visited many famous mountain shrines and never seen anything quite like it. Perhaps some awakened soul once resided here. Why not go in and see?” Entering, he found only a decrepit old monk making congee. Initially, Yucun paid no special attention; yet when he tried speaking with the monk, he realized that the poor man was not only deaf but muddled in mind, missing many teeth, and entirely unable to give coherent answers. Yucun quickly grew impatient, so he withdrew. He decided instead to seek out a small tavern for a few cups of wine, hoping to enhance his rustic outing.

He had barely reached the door of a countryside wine shop when a man seated at a table inside rose with a laugh and called out, “What a fortunate coincidence—truly a chance encounter!” Yucun looked closer and recognized him: it was Leng Zixing, once known to him in the capital, a merchant who dealt in antiques. Yucun had always admired Leng Zixing’s resourcefulness and skill, and Zixing, for his part, respected Yucun’s reputation as a cultured scholar. The two shared a close rapport. Overjoyed by this meeting, Yucun exclaimed, “When did you arrive here, Brother Leng? I had no idea! Fate truly smiles on us today.” Zixing answered, “I reached home at the end of last year and must soon return to the capital. I came here to see an acquaintance, who insisted I stay on a few more days. As I was idly strolling this afternoon, we happened upon each other—indeed, what a marvelous chance!” He invited Yucun to join him at the table, setting out fresh cups and dishes so they could drink together.

They sipped slowly and made small talk, speaking of what had passed since they last met. Yucun asked, “Have you any recent news from the capital?” Zixing replied, “There is no major news, though a trifling oddity has happened in the family of your honorable clan.” Laughing, Yucun said, “I have no close relatives in the capital. What do you mean?” Zixing chuckled, “The two of you share the same surname, are you not kinsmen?” Yucun asked, “Which family are we talking about?” Zixing answered, “The Rong Guo branch—an illustrious household. One might say they do you no discredit.” Yucun nodded. “Oh, you must mean the house of the Duke of Rong. My own family lineage does indeed trace to them, but since that branch rose to such heights, we have had scant dealings with one another. Over time we’ve grown distant.” Zixing sighed, “No need to be so modest. Even the Ning and Rong mansions, once so grand, have begun to fade. It’s hardly like the old days.”

Surprised, Yucun asked, “Why should they be in decline? Formerly the Ning and Rong households had huge numbers of people. How have things withered so?” Zixing answered, “It’s a long story indeed.

“Last year, while you were in Jinling, you may have visited the Six Dynasties sites. If you passed Stone City, you might have seen that street with the Ning Mansion on the east side and the Rong Mansion on the west, dominating half the length of the lane. The grand gates stood mostly unused, but beyond the high walls, you could glimpse tall halls and pavilions, and in the rear gardens, the rocky groves looked lush and well-tended. You’d scarcely guess they were in any decline.” Yucun nodded. “Exactly so. The place did not appear ruined in the slightest.” Zixing laughed. “And you, a certified scholar, speak so naively? The ancients say, ‘Though a hundred-footed creature may die, it does not immediately go stiff.’ Externally, the Ning and Rong families show some pomp, but inside they are drained. The number of dependents has grown larger, the daily expenses keep rising, yet no one in the household truly knows how to manage. They cling to their old patterns of lavish living and cannot bring themselves to cut back. Though their outward appearance has not totally collapsed, their coffers are near empty. That alone might be manageable, but an even graver problem is that each new generation of sons grows more degenerate than the last.”

Yucun replied, “A family so steeped in letters and etiquette—how could they fail in educating their children? Especially the Ning and Rong lines, famous for strict upbringing—why would their descendants be so lacking?” Zixing sighed, “Indeed, I’m talking specifically about those two branches. Let me explain. The founding Duke of Ning had one brother, both sons of the same mother. The elder was Duke Ning, who in turn had two sons. After his death, the elder son, Jia Daihua, succeeded to his father’s title; he also had two sons, the first named Jia Fu, who died at eight or nine, and the second named Jia Jing, who succeeded the title after his brother’s death. Nowadays, that Jia Jing cares only for Taoist practices—burning cinnabar, refining mercury—and ignores all else. Fortunately, earlier in life, he fathered one son named Jia Zhen. Obsessed with becoming an immortal, Jia Jing let his son inherit the rank. Jia Jing himself won’t even reside at home, preferring to remain on the outskirts of the capital among fellow Taoists. So young Master Zhen had a child, Jia Rong, now about sixteen. With Jia Jing paying no attention to worldly matters, the Ning mansion is left in Jia Zhen’s hands, yet all he does is revel in high pleasures, turning the Ning mansion upside down with no one daring to interfere.

“As for the Rong Mansion, that’s where the oddity arises. When the founding Duke of Rong died, his son Jia Daishan inherited the title. Daishan married a woman from the aristocratic Shi clan of Jinling. They had two sons: Jia She, the elder, and Jia Zheng, the younger. Daishan has since passed away; his widow, the Dowager, is still living. The elder son, Jia She, inherited the official rank. He is no more than middling, scarcely involving himself in running the household. The younger son, Jia Zheng, was drawn to reading from childhood, serious and upright. His grandfather doted on him and hoped he would rise by the imperial examinations. But when Daishan died, the Emperor compassionately granted the inheritance to the older son, She, and at the same time asked whether there were other sons who merited official grace. Thus Jia Zheng was granted a special appointment as a probationary secretary in a ministry; by now he is an Assistant Department Director. Jia Zheng’s wife, Lady Wang, first bore a son named Jia Zhu. By fourteen, Zhu was already admitted to advanced studies; he soon married, had a child, and then—before he reached twenty—he fell sick and died. The second birth was a daughter, born on New Year’s Day itself, a rather auspicious coincidence. Then, over a decade later, another son was born under very strange circumstances: the moment he emerged from the womb, he held in his mouth a bright, multicolored piece of jade bearing engraved characters! Surely that counts as news, don’t you think?”

Jia Yucun exclaimed, “That is indeed unusual. His background must be extraordinary.” Zixing gave a faint smile. “That is what everyone says, so his grandmother loves him as a priceless treasure. When he was a year old, Master Zheng tried to test his future inclinations by placing all sorts of items in front of him to see what he would grab. As it happened, he ignored everything but women’s powders and hairpins, reaching for those instead. This displeased his father, who concluded, ‘He will grow up to be a rake who indulges in wine and lust,’ so he has not shown much affection for the boy. Only the old Dowager spoils him completely. Stranger still, the child is now past ten, truly mischievous yet exceptionally quick-witted—none can match him. He once said in all seriousness, ‘Girls are made of water, boys are made of mud. I feel refreshed whenever I see a girl, yet I find men foul and stifling.’ Is that not ridiculous? One might suspect he will be a libertine without a doubt!”

Yucun, suddenly stern, responded: “Not so! You simply do not understand this child’s underlying nature. Likely Master Zheng also errs in dismissing him as a creature of lust. Only one who has read widely, practiced self-reflection, and probed the mystical truths of the universe can discern his true origin.” Surprised by his vehemence, Zixing pressed him to explain. Yucun said, “When Heaven and Earth bring forth human beings, apart from those who are supremely good or supremely evil, most differ only slightly. The supremely good are born in times of harmony—‘they come in answer to the needs of the era’; the supremely evil are born in times of crisis—‘they come in response to turmoil.’ Good men nourish the world, evil men disturb it. Refined clarity and spiritual grace are Heaven’s rightful energies; these form the essence of the righteous. Brutality and perversity are the deviant energies of the cosmos; these mark the wicked.

“Today, in an age of flourishing imperial virtue, we see righteous energies everywhere. Any leftover clarity that cannot find a place in official or scholarly circles simply diffuses like gentle breezes and sweet dew, benefitting everyone. By contrast, the dark energies of cruelty and madness cannot roam freely in broad daylight. They gather in hidden pits and gullies. If by chance storms or clouds stir them, a wisp or two might escape. If they clash with the righteous energies out in the open, the two forces cannot yield nor overcome each other, so they erupt violently, shaping some extraordinary event or person. Such a person, be it male or female, will neither be wholly good nor wholly evil. Among the masses, their brilliance far surpasses the crowd, yet their perversity also plunges them far below ordinary folk. If born to a noble house, they become hapless slaves to passion. If born to a modest family of letters, they become a reclusive scholar or lofty recluse. Even if they are fated to be born in poverty, they might end up a famous actor or celebrated courtesan—never a mere underling or servant. Consider Xuyou, Tao Qian, Ruan Ji, Ji Kang, Liu Ling, the families of Wang and Xie, Gu Hu-tou, Chen Shizhong, Emperor Li Yu of the Chen—then Tang Minghuang, Emperor Huizong of Song, Liu Yong, Wen Feiqing, Mi Nangong, Shi Manqing, Liu Qiqing, Qin Shaoyou, or more recently Ni Yunlin, Tang Bohu, Zhu Zhishan. Then there were Li Guinian, Huang Fanchuo, Jing Xinmo, Zhuo Wenjun, Hongfu, Xue Tao, Cui Yingying, and Qiao Yun. All of these, though born in different times, were essentially of the same class of spirit.”

Zixing ventured a guess: “So, in modern parlance, ‘If they succeed, they become dukes; if they fail, they become rogues’—is that it?” Yucun nodded. “Exactly. You may not be aware that since my dismissal, I have traveled broadly for two years, encountering two unusual children. So when you spoke of this Jade-Born boy, I guessed at once he might be of that same lineage. No need for far-fetched proofs. Right in Jinling, there is the family of the Imperial Censor from the Tianren Academy, the Zhen household—familiar to you?” Zixing answered, “Who does not know them? The Zhen family has always been on intimate terms with the Jia family. I myself have had more than a passing acquaintance with them.” Yucun laughed, “During my stay in Jinling last year, someone recommended me as a tutor for their family. I took a look at their lavish estate, discovering that their wealth was matched by a refined love of decorum—truly a perfect place to teach. But oh, that pupil of mine was even more taxing than preparing a candidate for the imperial examinations. It was absurd. He insisted, ‘I can only recognize letters if I have two young ladies studying alongside me. That clears my mind. Otherwise, I can’t think at all.’ Or he would say to his valets, ‘The word for “daughter” is supremely precious and pure, rarer by far than any auspicious beast or exquisite flower. Your filthy tongues must never debase those two characters. The moment you speak them, you must first rinse your mouth with fresh water and fragrant tea, or else you should have your teeth knocked out and your eyes gouged!’ Such was his outlandish tyranny. Yet if classes ended and he went inside to see any of those girls, his manner turned gentle and courteous, bright and erudite—almost like another person. His father often whipped him viciously, but never could correct him. If the beating hurt too much, he would cry out, ‘Elder Sister! Younger Sister!’ which made the women of the house tease him: ‘When you’re in trouble, you call for your sisters—are you asking them to plead for you? Don’t you feel ashamed?’ His response was fascinating: ‘When the pain is dire, calling out “sister” somehow eases it. I cried once, and the pain truly lessened a bit. So I discovered a secret remedy—whenever I’m beaten, I’ll call out to my sisters continuously!’ Tell me that isn’t comical? His grandmother adored him and blamed the tutors or the father whenever he was punished, so I resigned and left. A boy like that will never follow his ancestors’ diligence and moral teachings. It is a pity—especially as his sisters are said to be extraordinary.”

Zixing laughed, “The same can be said of the three young ladies in the Jia family. Master Zheng’s eldest daughter is named Yuanchun. For her talent, virtue, and filial piety, she was selected to serve in the palace as a lady-in-waiting. The second daughter is Yingchun, born to Master She’s concubine. The third daughter is Tan-chun, born to a concubine of Master Zheng. The fourth is Xi-chun, full sister of young Master Zhen in the Ning Mansion, but entrusted to her grandmother’s care. All of them study and live together, and each is said to be admirable.” Yucun remarked, “Intriguing that the Zhen household uses male generational names for their daughters, whereas the Jia family ends up with more conventional names, all containing the character ‘chun’—Spring. That feels rather… ordinary.” Zixing answered, “Not quite. The eldest is called Yuanchun because she was born on New Year’s Day; the rest follow her lead by using a ‘Spring’ name. The older generation used the brothers’ generational pattern, for instance, Master Lin’s wife was called Jia Min in her youth. If you doubt it, you can always inquire. You’ll recall she was an actual daughter of the Rong house.” Yucun clapped his hands and laughed. “That explains it. The young lady I have been tutoring is named Daiyu, who always pronounces her mother’s name ‘Min’ as though it were ‘Mi’ when she reads, or omits a stroke when she writes. That has puzzled me. Now I see it’s because her mother was a Jia daughter from the Rong household, so she will not fully voice or write the name. That clarifies a great deal—no wonder the child stands out from ordinary girls. Her mother must have been exceptional to bear such a daughter, so discovering she is from the Rong clan does not surprise me at all. It’s only a pity that she died last month.” He sighed. “She was likely the only older ‘sister’ left, and now she is gone. Let us hope the younger generation finds a good future marriage.”

Yucun added, “So Master Zheng has a jade-bearing son, plus the grandson left behind by his elder son Zhu. Does Master She have no son?” Zixing answered, “After that jade-bearing boy was born, Master Zheng’s wife had another child, but I don’t know how that one fares. Anyway, he already has two sons and one grandson. As for Master She, yes, he has a son named Jia Lian, who is over twenty. In a union tying noble houses together, Lian married the niece of Lady Wang—Master Zheng’s wife—about four or five years ago. Now he has purchased a rank of sub-prefect. He does not trouble himself with official duties so much; he’s clever and articulate, adept at navigating society. At present, he lives in Master Zheng’s house, helping manage family affairs. Ever since he married that lady, however, she has overshadowed him in everyone’s eyes. She is exceedingly fine-boned, lively of speech, and shrewd in judgment—by all accounts, an exceptional woman. Few men can match her.” Laughing, Yucun said, “See? That aligns with what we said: these people may well be those who combine both upright and wayward energies, all cast from the same mold.”

At this, Zixing declared, “Enough of analyzing others—come, have another cup!” Yucun smiled, “Indeed, we’ve been so absorbed in conversation I’ve had a good few cups already. But talking about others’ household affairs is the perfect way to complement wine, so why not drink even more?” Glancing outside, Yucun added, “It grows late. We must be careful not to find the city gates closed upon us. Let’s stroll back slowly and continue our talk.” Thus they rose, paid the bill, and prepared to leave. Just then, they heard a voice from behind them call, “Master Yucun, my congratulations! I’ve come especially to bring good news.” Yucun turned about in astonishment—

Who could it be? We must wait for the next chapter to find out.
Chapter 3
Through Lin Ruhai’s Recommendation, Jia Yucun Gains a Tutoring Post;
Grandmother Jia Feels Compassion for Her Orphaned Granddaughter

When Jia Yucun turned around, he recognized the newcomer as none other than Zhang Rugui, a onetime colleague who had been dismissed in the same case that led to Jia Yucun’s own removal from office. Zhang, who was from this area, had lived in retirement since his dismissal. Hearing rumors that the court intended to reinstate certain former officials, he roamed all about making inquiries and seeking connections. On encountering Jia Yucun by chance, he rushed over to congratulate him. The two exchanged greetings, and Zhang explained the news in detail. Overjoyed, Yucun briefly discussed the matter with him, then they parted ways.

Leng Zixing, having overheard, hastened to offer his advice: Yucun should seek help from Lin Ruhai, who in turn could approach the capital and plead with Jia Zheng. Yucun thanked him for the suggestion and went straight back to his lodging. First, he examined the official bulletins and found the tidings confirmed. The next day, he presented himself to Lin Ruhai. After listening, Lin Ruhai said, “It seems our destinies align. My humble wife has recently passed away, and my mother-in-law in the capital has long wished to have our young daughter by her side. The family already sent boats for them, but owing to my daughter’s fragile health, she has yet to depart. Now, I’ve long owed you for your teaching—an obligation I haven’t yet repaid. In this chance circumstance, how can I fail to do all in my power on your behalf? I have already prepared a recommendation letter that I will entrust to my brother-in-law, urging him to assist you wholeheartedly. As for costs incurred, I shall specify everything in my letter to the family so you need not trouble yourself.” Jia Yucun bowed repeatedly in gratitude, barely able to express his thanks. Then he asked, “Might I learn what office your honored relative presently holds? I should hate to call on him without proper ceremony.” Lin Ruhai smiled. “My wife’s family is, in fact, closely related to yours. He is the grandson of Old Duke Rong. My brother-in-law currently holds the rank of First-Class General by inheritance; his name is Jia She, styled Enhou. I also have another brother-in-law, with the courtesy name Cunzhou, serving now as Assistant Department Director in the Ministry of Works. His character is humble, sincere, and reminiscent of our forebear’s upright ways—no frivolous dandy. Were it otherwise, I would not stoop to entrust them with your matter, and you would not condescend to accept, either.” At these words, Jia Yucun recalled Leng Zixing’s information from the previous day and felt reassured. He thanked Lin Ruhai once again. Then Lin Ruhai said, “I plan for my daughter to leave for the capital on the second day of next month. You can accompany her, and that should prove convenient for both of you.” Jia Yucun gladly complied and looked forward to the journey. Lin Ruhai prepared gifts and farewell banquets, all of which Jia Yucun gratefully received.

As for the young lady, she herself was hesitant to leave her father, but her maternal grandmother insisted. Lin Ruhai reasoned with her: “My dear, your father is now over fifty, and he has no desire to remarry. You are frequently ill, and still so young. You have neither mother’s guidance above nor a younger sister’s companionship below. If you stay here alone, I shall remain worried on your behalf. With your grandmother and your maternal uncles and cousins in the capital, you’ll be cared for, which will ease my mind.” Hearing this, Daiyu wept tears of reluctant farewell but could not refuse. So, accompanied by her nurse and several older women from the Rong Mansion, she boarded the boat. Jia Yucun traveled in a separate craft with two servant-boys, joining her entourage for the journey.

Some days later, they reached the imperial capital. Jia Yucun quickly changed into his best attire and, accompanied by a page, carried a formal calling card from his so-called “clan nephew” and presented himself at the gate of the Rong Mansion. Jia Zheng, who had already received Lin Ruhai’s letter, immediately summoned him. Seeing that Yucun was tall and imposing in appearance, and that his conversation was cultivated, Jia Zheng—a man who valued scholars above all else—took a particular interest. Moreover, since Lin Ruhai had written on Yucun’s behalf, Jia Zheng treated him with special courtesy, doing everything in his power to help. Soon, at the time of the official petitions, Yucun was reinstated to service. Within two short months, he was appointed to the prefecture of Jinling (Yingtian Prefecture). After taking leave of Jia Zheng and selecting an auspicious day, he left to assume his new post—no need to dwell on that further.

Now we turn to Daiyu. The day she disembarked from the boat, she found that the Rong Mansion had already sent sedan chairs and carts for luggage. She remembered her mother’s words, warning that her maternal grandmother’s household was unlike all others. The few maids and matrons she had met thus far—though only of middle rank—already displayed uncommon splendor in dress and manners. How much more imposing would the main house be! She resolved to watch her every step and guard her words, speaking only when appropriate. Once she climbed into the sedan chair and entered the city, she peered through the gauze window and beheld markets brimming with activity—far beyond anything she had known.

They traveled on for half a day until they saw, on the north side of the street, two large stone lions guarding a triple gateway with carved animal heads. Men of imposing attire and bearing sat in a row out front. The main doors remained closed, with activity only at the eastern and western side gates. A grand signboard above read: “By Imperial Command—The Ningguo Mansion.” Daiyu surmised: That must be the home of my eldest maternal uncle. Not far to the west stood an identical set of three grand gates with the inscription “Rongguo Mansion.” They did not enter through the principal gate but turned instead through the western corner gate. After the chair had been carried about an arrow’s flight into the mansion’s compound, the bearers paused at a bend to switch crews. The older women got out, replaced by four neatly dressed young pages of about seventeen, who carefully lifted her sedan chair while the other matrons followed on foot.

They arrived before a gate adorned with drooping flowers, where the young pages withdrew. Some matrons came to lift the sedan’s curtain and help Daiyu alight. She took a maid’s arm and passed through the drooping-flower gate, proceeding along a corridor lined with carved pillars on either side. In the center stood a screen wall of purple sandalwood inlaid with marble. Beyond that, an intimate three-room hall, which led to the main courtyard of the principal residence: five splendid rooms in a row, adorned with carved beams and painted rafters. Long corridors connecting side rooms hosted an assortment of birds—parrots, thrushes—singing on their perches. On the terrace steps sat several young maids, dressed in bright reds and greens. As soon as they saw Daiyu’s group approach, they rose with smiles to greet her: “The Old Madam was just speaking of you; how fortunate that you’ve arrived!” Three or four of them vied to lift the curtain, chirping, “Miss Lin is here!” Daiyu stepped inside the room.

At that moment, two attendants were helping an elderly lady with hair white as silver to rise and move forward. Daiyu realized this must be her grandmother. She hastily prepared to kneel, but Grandmother Jia—already embracing her—pulled her into her arms, weeping aloud, “My dearest, my heart’s flesh!” So earnest was her crying that all present were moved to tears. Daiyu too burst into sobs. Eventually, the others persuaded them to quiet down. When Daiyu had finished paying her respects, Grandmother Jia introduced her around: “This is your eldest aunt… this is your second aunt… and here is Zhu’s widow, your late elder cousin’s wife.” Daiyu bowed to each in turn. Grandmother Jia then said, “Invite the young ladies over. They needn’t attend lessons today since our guest has arrived from afar.” The others assented, and two of them left. A short time later came three nursemaids and five or six maids, escorting three young ladies. The first was slightly full-figured, her cheeks as lustrous as fresh litchi peel, her nose as pure as polished jade. Mild-tempered and reserved, she evoked immediate sympathy. The second had sloping shoulders, a slender waist, an elongated figure, an oval face, bright eyes, and gracefully curved brows. Her every glance conveyed spirit, her every look a spark of life. The third was younger, not yet fully grown. All three wore the same style of hair ornaments, jackets, and skirts. Quickly Daiyu stood to greet them, and they returned her courtesies before taking seats. A maid offered them tea. Conversation touched upon how Daiyu’s mother had fallen ill, sought treatments, and eventually died. This moved Grandmother Jia to fresh sorrow. She lamented, “Among all my children, I loved your mother best… yet she left this world before me; I never even saw her in those final days. How can I not grieve!” So saying, she clutched Daiyu’s hand and wept once more. The others swiftly comforted her, and after a while, her tears subsided.

Observing Daiyu—though still a child—carried herself with refined grace and spoke in cultured tones, they guessed she suffered from ill health, for her delicate build was evident. They asked what medicines she took and why she wasn’t better yet. Daiyu explained, “I’ve been this way since infancy. From the time I could eat solid food, I have been taking medicine. I’ve seen countless famous doctors, but all to no avail. I recall when I was barely three, a monk with a diseased scalp came, wanting to take me away and make me a novice. Naturally, my parents refused. He told them: ‘Since you’re unwilling to part with her, then be warned that her illness may never be cured. Should you want her well, forbid from now on her hearing any cries of grief. Apart from her father and mother, do not let her see other relatives, and then, perhaps, she will pass her days in peace.’ He was wild, babbling nonsense, and no one took him seriously. For now, I take ginseng-yangrong pills.” Grandmother Jia said, “Well, that’s convenient. I’m having pills made right now. I’ll have them make extra for you.”

She was still speaking when, from the rear courtyard, they heard a lively voice exclaim, “I’m late—no one came to greet our guest from afar!” Daiyu wondered who on earth spoke so boldly when everyone else here seemed so discreet. A moment later, a cluster of maids and married women bustled in, attending a young woman of striking beauty, dressed differently from the girls—her garments glittered with embroidered splendor, like some divine consort descending from on high. Her hair was coiffed into an eight-jewel chignon, pinned with golden phoenix hairpins bedecked with pearls. Her neck wore a band of twisted gold shaped like mythical dragons. Over a fitted red jacket embroidered with golden butterflies she had thrown a five-color damask surcoat lined with silver-gray fur, while her skirt was a pleated satin woven with flower motifs. Her eyes were slightly angled, like a phoenix, and her brows were slender as willow leaves. Tall and lithe, her features carried an undercurrent of humor and allure. Though her expression brimmed with cheer, an air of authority shone through. At once, Daiyu rose to greet her. Grandmother Jia smiled, “You wouldn’t recognize her. She’s the famous sharp-tongued one among us—back home, we call her ‘Feng the Hot Pepper.’ You can just call her ‘Feng Pepper’ if you want.” Unsure how to address her, Daiyu glanced at the young ladies, who whispered, “This is Second Sister-in-Law Lian.” Daiyu, recalling her mother’s mention that her elder cousin Jia Lian—son of her maternal uncle Jia She—had married a niece of her second aunt. This woman was raised as though she were a boy and was named Wang Xifeng. So Daiyu greeted her with a respectful smile and called her “Sister-in-law.”

Wang Xifeng took Daiyu’s hand, looked her up and down, then led her back to Grandmother Jia and all sat together. Laughing, she said, “We have such a lovely young cousin here! This is the first time I’ve seen such fresh beauty! And what a noble bearing, so reminiscent of Grandmother’s own granddaughters. No wonder she’s kept you in her thoughts day and night. How I pity that, with such a fate, your poor mother had to pass on!” She dabbed at her eyes with a handkerchief. Grandmother Jia said, “I just got over my own tears—don’t stir me up again. Our darling granddaughter only arrived today, frail besides, so please don’t bring up anything sorrowful.” Immediately, Wang Xifeng switched from sadness to a smile: “Yes, yes! Once I saw this little cousin, my heart was entirely on her—mixed joy and sorrow. I got carried away. I deserve scolding!” She turned to Daiyu, “How old are you, cousin? Have you studied? What medicines do you take? Don’t pine for home here. If you need anything to eat or use, come to me. And if any maids or elderly women cause you trouble, just tell me.” Daiyu answered each question politely. Wang Xifeng next asked, “Has anyone moved Miss Lin’s things in yet? How many people has she brought with her? Best hurry and ready two rooms so she can rest.” As she spoke, refreshments were served. Wang Xifeng poured out the tea and offered it around. At that moment, Lady Wang asked, “Have you paid out the monthly allowances?” Wang Xifeng nodded, “Finished that. Just now we went to the rear storeroom loft for some silk but couldn’t find the length you mentioned. Maybe you remembered incorrectly.” Lady Wang said lightly, “If it’s not there, it doesn’t matter.” Then she continued, “We should have taken out a few bolts for your cousin to make some clothes. But I’ll think of it tonight.” Wang Xifeng replied, “I already anticipated that. Knowing little sister would arrive soon, I set some cloth aside. I’ll have it approved and then bring it to you.” Lady Wang smiled, nodding without comment.

Before long, the tea and snacks were cleared, and Grandmother Jia asked two old matrons to take Daiyu to see her uncles. At once, Jia She’s wife, Lady Xing, rose with a laugh: “Allow me to take my niece there. It’s somewhat easier that way.” Grandmother Jia smiled, “Yes, indeed. Off you go—and no need to come back.” Lady Xing agreed. Taking Daiyu, she made her farewells to the group; they were escorted to the entrance hall. There, waiting, was a pale-green curtained carriage. Lady Xing and Daiyu boarded, and when the attendants closed the curtains, the young pages pulled the cart forward. At a suitable spot, they harnessed a well-trained mule, exited through the mansion’s west corner gate, then turned east, passing in front of the Rong Mansion’s main entrance before entering a black-lacquered side gate. They halted at the protocol gate, disembarked, and went into the courtyard. Daiyu deduced that this must be a part of the mansion separated by a flower garden, because upon passing three layers of gateways, she saw small but elegantly arranged halls, corridors, and grotto-like features—distinctly unlike the imposing grandeur of the main compound. The garden trees and rocky hills exuded a pleasant serenity.

Entering the main house, they were greeted by a throng of beautiful, finely dressed concubines and maids. Lady Xing offered Daiyu a seat and sent someone to the outer study to announce their arrival to Jia She. Soon, a message came back: “The master says his health has been poor these days, and meeting his niece might sadden both sides, so he refrains from seeing her for now. He advises her not to grieve or feel homesick. Living with your aunts and cousins is the same as being at home. Though these cousins may be ordinary, they can keep you company and help you pass the time. If you feel any grievance, just speak up—do not hold back.” Daiyu rose at once to convey her gratitude. After sitting a while, Lady Xing insisted she stay for a meal, but Daiyu replied, “Dear Aunt, your generous invitation is too kind. Normally I would accept, but I still have to pay my respects to my second uncle. It would be improper if I delayed too long. Let me visit another day instead, if you’ll kindly excuse me.” Lady Xing smiled, “All right then.” Summoning two older matrons, she had them bring the same carriage from before. Daiyu took her leave, and Lady Xing followed to the protocol gate, gave final instructions to the servants, and watched them depart.

Shortly afterward, Daiyu arrived at another section of the Rong Mansion. Alighting from the carriage, she noticed a main path leading straight out to the grand gates, but the matrons guiding her turned east. After a hallway, a south-facing hall, and another protocol gate, they reached a spacious courtyard with five main rooms, flanked by side chambers. This layout, with its imposing architecture, suggested the principal inner quarters. Entering the reception hall, Daiyu glanced up and saw a large plaque of gilded dragons on a blue ground. It bore three huge characters reading “Hall of Glorious Felicity,” accompanied by a smaller line of text, “Inscribed in such-and-such year, granted to Duke Rongguo, Jia Yuan,” plus an imperial seal. On a purple sandalwood table carved with dragons stood an ancient bronze censer; nearby were an ornate gold brazier and a glass container for flowers. Down the middle, two rows of sixteen polished nanmu chairs. A pair of large ebony boards engraved in gold carried a matching couplet:

“From this seat, pearls and gems reflect the sun and moon;
Before this hall, brocaded robes shimmer like clouds and mist.”
Below it, tiny script indicated it was written by someone titled “Successor to the noble rank of the Duke of Dong’an.” Since Lady Wang typically did not sit in this main chamber except on formal occasions, she usually occupied three adjoining rooms on the east side. The matrons led Daiyu through the eastern door. Near a window stood a raised brick bed (kang) covered with bright red Western-style carpeting. Facing the wall was a large red-and-gold pillow and a big comforter patterned with money-coin designs in autumn hues. On each side stood a small painted lacquer stand. On the left, a tripod vessel in the style of King Wen, along with a box for incense. On the right, a pale-blue beauty vase holding fresh seasonal flowers. Below, four large chairs lined up, each covered with silver-red seat covers, and four footstools. A pair of tall stands displayed bowls and vases. Such was the room’s arrangement, which need not be detailed further. The old matrons asked Daiyu to sit on the kang. Observing the seat of honor, she hesitated and instead took a place on a nearby chair. At once, the mansion’s maids brought tea. Daiyu, as she sipped, noted their attire and graceful bearing—unlike those of an ordinary household.

Her tea was still unfinished when a girl wearing a red jacket and a blue silk vest approached with a smile: “My lady wishes Miss Lin to move to her other room.” Hearing this, the elderly matrons led Daiyu next door to a smaller set of three rooms, also to the east and south. Within, a kang table was spread with books and tea things; behind it, a half-worn blue silk quilt with matching pillows. Lady Wang sat on a lower seat to the west, also covered with well-used blue silk. Seeing Daiyu enter, she gestured toward the east side. Daiyu guessed it was Jia Zheng’s place, so she glanced at the three chairs in a row below, each topped with old seat covers. She went there instead. Lady Wang urged her again to come onto the kang, so finally she sat next to Lady Wang at the edge of it. Lady Wang said: “Your uncle is away fasting at the temple. You may meet him next time. But there’s something I wish to tell you. Your three girl cousins are all very well. You’ll share lessons in reading and needlework, and amuse yourselves together. But there is one concern: I have a bane of this household, a ‘little demon king.’ Today he’s out at the temple, fulfilling a vow, and hasn’t returned. Later, you’ll see him. My advice is: pay him no heed. Even your sisters do their best to avoid him.” Daiyu recalled her mother’s stories of a nephew born with a precious jade in his mouth, prone to unruly behavior, disliking books, and constantly mixing with the girls’ quarters. Yet Grandmother spoiled him, so no one dared correct him. Now Lady Wang’s warning confirmed it. Daiyu responded politely, “I’ve heard of the jade-bearing cousin—Mother spoke of him at home. He’s older than me by a year, called Baoyu. She said he may be stubborn but is very kind to his sisters. Besides, I’ll mostly stay with my girl cousins, while the boys live separately. We shouldn’t have much contact.” Lady Wang smiled. “The trouble is, he’s not like other boys. From infancy, the Old Madam has doted on him, raising him in the inner quarters among his sisters. If you girls ignore him, he’s calm enough. But if one of you laughs with him and gives him attention, his excitement grows, and then trouble soon follows. So just keep clear of him. One minute he’s all sweet words, the next he’s talking nonsense—heed nothing he says.” Daiyu nodded in acknowledgment.

Just then, a maid entered announcing, “The Old Madam calls everyone to supper.” Lady Wang rose, taking Daiyu along. They exited through the rear door, passed along an east-west corridor, and walked through a corner gate leading south. There stood a small three-room annex, and to the north rose a pink-washed screen wall. Beyond lay a modest gate and small courtyard. Lady Wang pointed it out to Daiyu: “That’s your cousin Feng’s place. You’ll know where to find her if you need anything. Anything lacking, just ask.” Even at this side yard gate stood several young pages, lined up at attention. Going on, they entered another passage hall, leading to Grandmother Jia’s inner court. There in the rear hall stood many waiting attendants. On Lady Wang’s arrival, they prepared tables and chairs. Li Wan—widow of the late Jia Zhu—came forward with cups; Wang Xifeng arranged chopsticks; Lady Wang placed the main dishes. Grandmother Jia alone sat at the central seat of a heated dais. Four empty chairs stood around. Xifeng guided Daiyu to the leftmost of these, but Daiyu demurred until Grandmother Jia laughed, “Your aunt and nieces don’t dine here. You are our guest—this is proper.” Only then did Daiyu timidly sit down. Grandmother Jia also signaled Lady Wang to be seated. Then Yingchun took the right-hand seat, Tan-chun the left-hand second, Xi-chun the right-hand second. Around them, maids and attendants stood silently with dusters, washbasins, and napkins. Li Wan and Xifeng served as attendants by the table. Outside, countless women servants waited, yet one heard scarcely a breath. The meal concluded in quiet. Each person received tea on a small tray. In her own home, Daiyu was accustomed to waiting a while after eating before taking tea, but seeing the protocols here, she followed suit, rinsed her mouth, and accepted the tea a second time. Then Grandmother Jia said, “You may all withdraw so we can chat in peace.” Lady Wang rose and, after a few polite words, led Li Wan and Feng away.

Grandmother Jia asked Daiyu what books she had read. Daiyu answered, “I’ve only begun on The Four Books.” Daiyu in turn inquired what her cousins studied, and Grandmother Jia replied, “They only recognize a few characters—nothing beyond that.” She had barely finished when they heard footsteps in the hall outside. A maid announced, “Master Baoyu has arrived.” Daiyu wondered what kind of lazy and insolent fellow this might be. But in walked a bright young man. On his head he wore a noble coronet inlaid with gems, while a gold-embroidered band circled his forehead, adorned with twin dragons playing with a pearl. Over a crimson coat patterned with golden butterflies he wore a belt of many-colored threads, and a bright-blue flowered cape lined with tassels. His boots were high-soled and finely stitched. His face shone like the mid-autumn moon, his complexion as lovely as spring blossoms. The line of his hair looked carved with a blade, his brows painted with ink, his nose shaped like a pendant gallbladder, and his eyes limpid as autumn waters. When angry, he appeared to smile; when he glanced around, it seemed full of affection. A golden cord and a five-colored silk sash hung around his neck, suspending a piece of precious jade. Daiyu was startled, thinking, Strange—I feel as though I’ve seen him before. Baoyu stepped forward to greet his grandmother. She said, “Go see your mother.” He turned away. Some time later he returned, dressed more simply. His hair in short braids around the head, gathered into one thick plait at the crown, threaded with gold and pearls. Over a half-worn silver-red robe, he retained his amulets and charms, and wore green-patterned breeches, thick socks, and bright red shoes, a style that made his face appear even more fair and his lips more roseate. He carried himself with natural grace. A later commentator wrote two short poems in the tune “West River Moon” describing his disposition:

I
Aimlessly seeking sorrow, contriving grief,
Sometimes he acts a fool, seeming half mad.
Though gifted with a handsome form,
Inside is merely thorny growth.
Unsteady in mundane matters,
Too stubborn to suffer through schooling,
Odd in his ways and perverse in temper—
How can he avoid the world’s scorn?
II
Though rich, he knows not the worth of diligence;
If poor, he cannot endure desolation.
Alas, he wastes his best years,
Profiting neither home nor realm.
The most incapable under heaven,
The least dutiful through all the ages,
A warning for heirs of noble lines:
Do not follow this boy’s example!
Be that as it may, when Grandmother Jia saw him return, she teased, “You saw no guests, yet you already changed your clothes. Go greet your cousin.” Baoyu, having spotted a graceful figure off to the side, guessed she must be the daughter of his Aunt Lin. Quickly he went to greet her. Daiyu looked closely at him: truly different from ordinary youths. She herself appeared:

Two slender brows, drawn together as though in sorrow,
Eyes brimming with subtle emotion—half joy, half gloom.
A face brushed by tears, a frame weighed by frailty.
Gently she breathes, a hidden fragrance.
Quiet and still, like a flower mirrored in water;
Softly she moves, like a willow caressed by the wind.
She thinks deeper than Bi Gan, having an extra chamber in her heart,
She pines more than Xi Shi, outdoing her by three degrees.
Baoyu, smiling, declared, “I’ve met this cousin before.” Grandmother Jia laughed, “What nonsense—when have you ever met her?” He said, “Though I’ve never seen her, I feel as if we’re old friends reuniting.” His grandmother beamed, “Very good—then you two will get along nicely.”

He then sidled next to Daiyu for a closer look and inquired, “Cousin, have you studied?” Daiyu replied, “I haven’t studied much—just recognized some characters at a small school for a year.” Then he asked, “What is your honorable name?” She told him. “Have you a style-name?” he continued. “No,” said Daiyu. “Then let me bestow one on you: how about ‘Pinpin?’—‘the Frowning One.’” Tanchun asked, “What’s your basis for that?” Baoyu explained, “The Comprehensive Record of People Past and Present mentions ‘Stone from the Western Hills—“dai”—can be used in place of brow ink.’ Look how her brows gather slightly, as if in a frown. Isn’t that elegant?” Tanchun teased, “You probably made that up.” Baoyu retorted, “One finds more than enough fabrications if we look beyond the Four Books.” He turned again to Daiyu, “Do you have a jade?” No one else understood his question. Daiyu guessed that because he himself had a jade, he was curious if she did as well. She said, “I don’t. That object of yours truly is rare—how could everyone have one?” Instantly, Baoyu’s face darkened with rage. Tearing his jade from his neck, he hurled it to the ground, snarling, “Precious object, indeed! And who can tell if it’s spiritual or not? I don’t want this worthless thing!” The whole company was thrown into commotion. People scrambled to pick up the jade. Alarmed, Grandmother Jia held him fast. “You little fiend! You can throw a tantrum if you wish, but why fling that precious life-token?” Baoyu wept, “All my sisters lack one, and only I have it—how unfair! Now here’s this fairy-like cousin, and she doesn’t have one either. That proves it’s worthless.” Grandmother Jia hastened to console him, “Actually, your cousin had a jade just like yours, but at her mother’s death, they placed it in the coffin—both to fulfill her daughterly devotion and to accompany her mother’s spirit. Naturally, she didn’t wish to boast of it in front of you, so she denied having one. Put it on again before your mother sees—she’d be upset.” She took the jade from a maid, personally tied it around his neck. Baoyu mulled her words, then shrugged off his anger.

Meanwhile, Daiyu’s nurse came to ask about her living arrangements. Grandmother Jia decided, “We’ll move Baoyu out of the small partition so he can stay with me in the inner suite. Then let Miss Lin occupy the painted nook behind the partition. After winter’s over, I’ll have new rooms prepared for them both.” Baoyu said, “My dear grandmother, why move me? I’ll be just fine in that nook outside the bedchamber, so as not to disturb you.” Grandmother Jia considered, “Very well.” Each was assigned a nurse and a maid to supervise them, with others to stand by outside. Right away, Wang Xifeng sent over a lotus-pink bed canopy, along with quilts of brocade and satin. Daiyu had arrived with only two attendants: her old nurse, Wang Furen (often addressed as Wang Nanny), and a ten-year-old maid called Xueyan. On seeing that Xueyan was merely a child herself, and that Wang Nanny was quite elderly, Grandmother Jia feared Daiyu would find them unsatisfactory, so she gave her one of her own second-tier maids, named Yingge. Just as each granddaughter—Yingchun, Tanchun, and Xichun—had their own arrangement of nursemaids, plus four supervising grannies and two or three personal maids, Daiyu was now similarly settled. Wang Nanny and Yingge would sleep alongside Daiyu in that painted alcove. Baoyu’s wet nurse, Li Nanny, and his primary maid, Xiren, stayed on the outer bed near him.

That maid Xiren had once served Grandmother Jia, going by the name Ruizhu. Because Grandmother Jia doted on Baoyu, she wanted him to have a good maid, so she presented Ruizhu to him. Seeing she was surnamed Hua, Baoyu recalled a verse, “A floral fragrance steals upon a person.” He told Grandmother Jia and had her name changed to “Xiren.” Yet for all her devotion, Xiren was somewhat anxious: when she had served Grandmother Jia, her every thought was for the Old Madam; now that she served Baoyu, her sole focus was on him. But Baoyu’s peculiar nature worried her; she tried to guide and caution him, yet he seldom listened, leaving her vexed.

That night, Baoyu and Li Nanny were both asleep when Xiren noticed that from within the partition, Daiyu and Yingge were still awake. Having removed her own makeup, she tiptoed in and softly asked, “Why haven’t you gone to sleep yet, Miss?” Daiyu hastily rose, inviting her to sit. Yingge giggled, “Our Miss here is upset—crying quietly, saying that just on her first day, she caused the young master’s tantrum. Suppose he had broken his jade—wouldn’t that have been her fault? I managed to calm her at last.” Xiren said, “Dear Miss, please don’t take that kind of thing to heart. You’ll see far stranger incidents than that. If you were to fret every time, you’d never stop. Better not let it trouble you.” Daiyu replied, “Thank you for your kind advice. I’ll keep it in mind.” They spoke briefly before settling down to rest.

At dawn, after paying respects to Grandmother Jia, Daiyu headed to Lady Wang’s quarters. She found Lady Wang and Wang Xifeng opening letters from Jinling, and also listening to two women from Lady Wang’s brother and sister-in-law. Daiyu did not fully understand, but Tanchun and the others knew they were discussing an incident involving the aunt’s family, the Xue clan of Jinling—particularly a cousin called Xue Pan, who had beaten someone to death in a dispute, and the case was under investigation at the Yingtian Prefecture. Now that Lady Wang’s brother, Wang Ziteng, had learned the details, he sent people with instructions to summon them to the capital.

What would happen next? We must await the next chapter.
Chapter 4
A Woeful Woman Encountering a Woeful Man;
A “Gourd” Monk Settles a “Gourd” Case

Daiyu and her cousins went to see Lady Wang and overheard her discussing family affairs with messengers from her brother and sister-in-law. They spoke of the legal troubles faced by her maternal relatives, involving a homicide. Since Lady Wang was quite busy, the cousins withdrew to visit Widow Li in her rooms. This Li was the wife of the late Jia Zhu. Though Zhu died young, he left one son, named Jia Lan, now five and already studying. Li herself hailed from a prominent family in Jinling. Her father, Li Shouzhong, had been President of the Imperial Academy; their clan held firmly that “a girl’s lack of talent is a virtue.” Thus, though Li was born into learning, she was taught only a bit of the Women’s Four Books and Biographies of Exemplary Women, introduced to a few characters, and acquainted with ancient paragons of female virtue. More essential in her upbringing were spinning, weaving, and female crafts. For this reason, she was named Li Wan, styled Gongcai (“Palace Seamstress”). So, although now a young widow in the midst of noble splendor, she lived as though numb and indifferent, asking no questions of the world. Her sole concern was attending her elders, raising her son, or quietly accompanying her sister-in-law and younger kinswomen in needlework or reading. Daiyu, as a guest, found daily company with these sisters- and nieces-in-law, thereby needing only her father for solace no longer.

Meanwhile, let us turn to Jia Yucun, who had been appointed Prefect of Yingtian (Jinling). Soon after taking office, he received a case involving homicide: two families fought over the purchase of a maid, leading to a beating that caused someone’s death. Jia Yucun summoned the plaintiff:

“The man who was killed was my master,” said the plaintiff. “He bought a maid, unaware that she’d been kidnapped by traffickers. The trafficker had already taken our silver but agreed that my young master would welcome her three days hence, which he deemed auspicious. Meanwhile, secretly, the trafficker sold the girl again to the powerful Xue family. We found out and tried to retrieve the maid, but the Xues—bullies who rely on their wealth—set their ruffians on us, beating my young master to death. The perpetrators fled, leaving no trace, while we, the powerless survivors, have sought justice for over a year to no avail. I beg Your Honor to track down these criminals. We who survive, as well as the deceased in spirit, would be ever grateful for your mercy!”
Outraged, Jia Yucun shouted, “How is it possible that someone was beaten to death and the murderers simply vanished without being seized?” He prepared to issue warrants for those involved. Suddenly, a gate-warden standing by signaled him to hold off. Puzzled, Yucun hesitated and did not send out the warrants. After adjourning court, he returned to his private chamber, dismissed his attendants, and asked the doorman alone to stay behind. The man bowed respectfully and then smiled:

“Your Honor, it’s been eight or nine years since you advanced in rank. Perhaps you don’t remember me?”
Yucun looked closely. “Your face does strike me as familiar, but I can’t place you.”

The man said, “Surely Your Honor has not forgotten the affairs at Gourd Temple! The disastrous fire? I was a novice monk there—too young to endure its desolation after the temple burned, so I let my hair grow and became a gate-warden instead. I did not expect our paths to cross again.”

At once, Yucun remembered and, much relieved, took the man’s hand, thanking him with a laugh. He invited him to sit—an honor the warden tried to decline. Yucun insisted, “In private rooms such as this, there’s no need for formality. You and I knew each other in humble days.”

After the man seated himself discreetly, Yucun asked, “Why earlier did you prevent me from issuing warrants?”

The warden replied, “Your Honor, newly arrived to this post, have you really not procured a copy of this province’s ‘Protector’s Talisman’ (huguanfu)?”

Yucun was taken aback. “What is that ‘Protector’s Talisman’?”

The warden explained, “Nowadays, every local magistrate privately keeps a sheet listing the wealthiest and most powerful families in the province. It’s the same across the empire. If one does not know this list and happens to offend one of these clans, not only might one’s office be lost, but even one’s life could be in peril. Thus the name ‘Protector’s Talisman.’ This Xue family you just heard about is absolutely not to be trifled with! Their homicide case is simple enough, but previous officials dared not press it due to their connections.”

As he spoke, he pulled a small slip of paper from his pocket and handed it to Yucun. On it were written the greatest local clan names, along with a popular rhyme describing them:

“Jia not ‘fake’: White jade halls and golden steeds.
Ah, that grand palace—three hundred li—still too small for even one Shi of Jinling.
Over the Eastern Sea, short of white jade beds, the Dragon King must come to Jinling’s Wang.
Abundance in the year of ‘great snow,’ pearls like dirt, gold like iron—lo, the Xues!”
Yucun had barely glanced at this cryptic verse when an attendant announced, “Lord Wang has arrived to pay his respects.” Yucun hurriedly changed clothes to greet him. An hour later, he returned to the side chamber and resumed conversation with the warden, who said:

“Those four families are all intermarried, sharing each other’s ups and downs. The murderer is from the Xue branch of this circle. Besides them, that family also has abundant connections in the capital and elsewhere. Whom can you arrest?”
Jia Yucun sighed, “Then how can I resolve this case? Judging from your expression, you must know the culprit’s hiding place?”

The warden nodded. “Let me tell you everything. The victim was a minor gentry youth named Feng Yuan, orphaned of father and mother, with no siblings, living on a modest inheritance. He was about eighteen or nineteen. By temperament, he favored male companions over women. This odd twist of fate meant that when he laid eyes on this particular girl, he resolved to purchase her as a wife, vowing never again to indulge in male beauty nor to take a second bride. He insisted on waiting three days before bringing her home, treating the event with gravity. Unexpectedly, the trafficker pocketed two sets of silver and tried to slip away. Before he could escape, both sides confronted him, refusing to yield or accept refunds: Feng’s side demanded the maid, so too did the Xues. Young Master Xue, known for arrogance and violence, had his servants beat Feng Yuan to a pulp. They carried him home half-dead; three days later, he died. Meanwhile, Master Xue had already been planning to leave for the capital. So after seizing the girl and murdering Feng Yuan, he calmly left town with his household. A mere homicide is trivial for them—money can fix everything.

“But do you know, Your Honor, who that kidnapped girl truly is?”
Startled, Yucun said, “I haven’t the faintest idea.”
The warden gave a chilling laugh: “She’s none other than the daughter of your greatest benefactor—Master Zhen of Gourd Temple’s neighborhood. The girl who vanished at five, named Yinglian.”
Jia Yucun gasped. “So it’s her! I once heard she was kidnapped, and no news surfaced till now. Why sell her only after so many years?”
The warden explained, “Traffickers often snatch little girls and raise them until they’re twelve or thirteen, then carry them to distant regions and sell them. That’s precisely Yinglian’s fate. We used to dandle her when she was small. Though it’s been seven or eight years, she hasn’t changed so much—still the same sweet face, with a tiny crimson birthmark on her brow. And wouldn’t you know it, this trafficker happened to rent my house. Recognizing her, I tried talking with her once while the trafficker was away. She was terrified, wouldn’t admit anything, only cried that her ‘father’ was in debt. A neighborly woman tried to comfort her, and she burst into tears, babbling, ‘At last my suffering shall end.’ She clearly hoped to find peace with Feng Yuan. He genuinely wanted to make her his wife. But ironically, just the next day, the trafficker sold her again to Xue! Whereupon Xue’s men battered poor Feng Yuan so badly that he died shortly after. Yinglian, once on the brink of a better life, was seized and dragged away like a piece of property, and we’ve no idea if she’s even alive.
“Think of it: Feng Yuan pinned all his hopes on this one purchase, intending to change his ways. She too had suffered so many years—ready to escape the trafficker at last. If the two had married, it might’ve been a lovely outcome. But disaster intervened: the Xues are wealthy, with countless concubines. How could their licentious master treasure her the way Feng Yuan would? Indeed, it’s a dreamlike twist of doomed romance, a pitiful pairing of star-crossed souls. Let us not dwell on that, however. Right now, how does Your Honor propose to close the case?”
Sighing, Yucun said, “Indeed, a wretched fate. As for the lawsuit, how am I to judge, especially after my reappointment under Imperial favor? I want to serve the court well, not twist the law for private ends.”

The warden gave a cynical laugh. “Surely that’s a noble stance, but in our present world, it’s hardly workable. As ancient wisdom says, ‘A wise man acts according to the times,’ and also, ‘A true gentleman avoids calamity.’ This may concern not only your ability to serve but even your personal safety. Please think carefully.”

Brooding for a while, Yucun asked, “What would you suggest?”

The warden answered, “A simple trick: tomorrow, when you hold court, make a big show—issue summons and warrants, claiming you’ll arrest the culprit. Naturally, no one will produce him, so the plaintiff will keep pressing. You bring in a few of Xue’s household members or clansmen and interrogate them. Meanwhile, I’ll work in secret to arrange for them to submit a statement: that the murderer has died of some sudden ailment, presumably haunted by his victim’s ghost. You, my lord, can set up a public ritual claiming you can consult the spirit realm. By employing a ‘planchette’ or some such mystic device, you declare, ‘The spirit of Feng Yuan meets Xue Pan by karmic destiny; their enmity is ancient and fated to be resolved this way. Now Xue Pan has died of an unidentifiable illness, his soul pursued by Feng Yuan’s ghost. The root of this tragedy lies with the trafficker, so let us punish him according to law. The rest are absolved.’ Then, if the trafficker is made to confess, everyone sees how the ‘ghost’s statement’ and the trafficker’s testimony match perfectly. They’ll believe the story. The Xues have plenty of money; you can fine them any sum—one thousand or five hundred taels—for Feng’s funeral costs. Feng’s family is small, desperate for funds; with the money, they’ll drop the suit. Wouldn’t that solve everything nicely?”

Yucun said, “Too brazen, surely. Let me think it over. If I do it, it must be executed flawlessly to silence gossip.” And so they plotted. The next day, in court, Yucun issued commands, demanded suspects, and loudly threatened to arrest the fugitive. In truth, they could find no one. Feng’s family, short on numbers and relying on the case for compensation, found themselves confronted by the wealthy Xues. Bound by special interests, Yucun contrived a miscarriage of justice, awarding funeral expenses to Feng’s kin and glossing over the homicide. Feng’s survivors, content with money, ceased all complaint. In haste, Yucun wrote two letters to Jia Zheng and to General Wang Ziteng, advising them that “your nephew’s affair is fully settled,” so neither need worry. Realizing the gate-warden from Gourd Temple knew his old poverty-stricken secrets, Yucun feared the man might speak too freely. Displeased, he found an excuse to send him away to a distant post, and thus rid himself of potential scandal.

Putting Jia Yucun’s affairs aside, let us see more about the Xue family themselves—purchasers of Yinglian and murderers of Feng Yuan. They too hailed from Jinling, heirs of a long line of scholars. The current master is Xue Pan, whose father died young. Overindulged by a doting widowed mother, he learned no skill and grew up idle but inherited vast wealth, reportedly more than a million in assets. A nominal “imperial merchant,” he had official connections to supply treasury funds and procure sundry materials, though he grasped little of the business. He spent his days gaming and reveling, barely literate. His widowed mother—Madame Wang—was the younger sister of Wang Ziteng, the newly promoted Commander of the Capital Garrison, and also sister to Lady Wang of Rongguo Mansion. She was about fifty, with only this single son, Xue Pan, and a daughter younger by two years, named Baochai. Baochai was fair-skinned and poised, born with an aura of grace. Her father, when alive, cherished her and taught her to read and write, so she far surpassed her brother academically. But after her father’s death, seeing how her brother failed to console their mother, Baochai ceased worrying about scholarship and took to household affairs, hoping to reduce her mother’s burdens.

The emperor’s current policy esteemed literary culture and drew talented women into the palace—some as imperial consorts or attendants, others as tutors or companions of princesses. After Xue Pan’s father’s death, the family’s stewards scattered or embezzled, letting many of their business holdings in the capital decline. Xue Pan dreamed of seeing the capital’s wonders, so he seized on this opportunity: first, escorting his sister for the selection process, second, visiting their maternal relatives, and third, auditing old account books while applying for new funds. In truth, he wanted to roam the imperial city. They had already gathered fine luggage, local specialties, and lavish gifts for their trip. Then came the unfortunate purchase of Yinglian. Upon slaying Feng Yuan in the squabble, Xue Pan simply left everything to his clan and senior retainers, off he went with his mother and sister. He treated the homicide as a trifle: money would set it right.

Traveling many days, they neared the capital, hearing that Uncle Wang Ziteng had been promoted to a border position and was about to leave the city on imperial assignment. Secretly elated, Xue Pan thought, Good, my uncle won’t be around to restrain me! The family deliberated how they should settle on arrival. Madame Wang remarked, “Our houses in the city have stood empty for a decade. The caretakers likely rented them out, so we should send men ahead to clean and vacate them.” But her son objected, “Why go to all that trouble? Let’s just stay with Uncle or Aunt for a while.”

His mother demurred, “Your uncle is in a flurry preparing to go out on official duty—wouldn’t it be awkward to show up unannounced with all our retinue? And your Aunt Wang, who is your mother’s own younger sister—she has long pressed us to come. Indeed, she would surely insist we stay. Yet you fear your uncle’s discipline, so you want to keep a distance, yes? But I’d rather see my sister after these years apart. You can always move out if you really dislike the rules.” Xue Pan realized he could not argue with her, so they rode straight to the Rong Mansion.

Lady Wang of the Rong Mansion had already heard that the homicide matter had been resolved thanks to Jia Yucun. Relieved, she also felt lonely after her brother’s departure for the frontier. One day, news came that her sister-in-law Madame Wang had arrived at the mansion gates with her son and daughter. Overjoyed, she rushed to greet them in the main hall. The sisters reunited, mingling laughter and tears. Exchanging stories of their long separation, they then went to pay respects to the matriarch, Grandmother Jia. Gifting the household with local specialties, they were welcomed with a grand banquet. Xue Pan, having formally greeted Jia Zheng and Jia Lian, was also introduced to Jia She and Jia Zhen. Jia Zheng privately suggested to Lady Wang:

“Your sister-in-law is older, her young son inexperienced. Living outside might invite trouble, so why not accommodate them in our empty Pear Fragrance Court on the southeast corner? A dozen vacant rooms are just sitting there—let them stay there. It would be quite fitting.”
Lady Wang agreed, and Grandmother Jia also sent word, “Do ask your sister to stay here, so we can all be close.” Madame Wang likewise preferred staying under their oversight, lest Xue Pan roam freely and spark mischief. She quietly told Lady Wang, “We’ll pay our share of daily expenses. That will avoid inconveniencing your family.” Lady Wang knew they were amply wealthy and didn’t mind, so she allowed it. Thus Madame Wang and her children settled into Pear Fragrance Court.

That small courtyard, once Duke Rong’s private retreat in his twilight years, was modest but complete, with a front hall, back chambers, and a separate entrance leading to the street. Xue Pan’s retainers could come and go via that side gate. A corner gate connected to a narrow passage that emerged near Lady Wang’s eastern residence. Each day or evening, Madame Wang would come to chat with Grandmother Jia or spend time with Lady Wang. Meanwhile, Baochai joined the girls—Daiyu, Yingchun, and the others—to read, play chess, sew, or simply pass the time pleasantly. Xue Pan, however, had initially wished to avoid living in the Jia household, dreading the watchful eyes of his uncles. But his mother, with the Jias’ earnest invitation, insisted. So he reluctantly remained, sending men to dust off their own home for later occupancy. Yet after less than a month in the mansion, Xue Pan had befriended half the young male cousins in the family—mostly idle aristocratic youths. They lured him into a cycle of feasting, sightseeing, gambling, debauchery—far worse than he had been back home. Though Jia Zheng prided himself on strict governance of his household, the clan was extensive, and it was impossible to manage each branch. Moreover, the official “head of family” was Jia Zhen of the Ning Mansion, a young man who had inherited his rank. Busy with both public and private matters, he was not inclined to meddle in trifles. The separate corner gate meant Xue Pan could roam freely. So, any thought of moving out gradually vanished from his mind.

What happens next? Let us await the following chapter.
Chapter 5
Jia Baoyu’s Spirit Wanders in the Realm of Great Void;
The Illusory Fairy Ballad Enacts the Dream of the Red Chamber

In the previous chapter, we noted the arrival of Xue Baochai and her mother to stay at the Rong Mansion. Hence we shall not repeat those details here and instead continue with our tale.

1. Daiyu and Baoyu: A Rift Followed by Reconciliation
Since Lin Daiyu’s arrival at the Rong Mansion, Grandmother Jia cherished her exceedingly, treating her in every way the same as Baoyu—providing her clothing, bedding, and daily meals with the same care. The three other granddaughters—Yingchun, Tanchun, and Xichun—were placed somewhat in the background. Naturally, this closeness heightened the bond between Baoyu and Daiyu, drawing them into intimate companionship. By day, they walked and sat side by side; by night, they rested and rose together, so perfectly attuned that words and sentiments flowed in harmony, as inseparable as adhesive glue.

However, an unexpected newcomer—Xue Baochai—upset the balance. Though near in age to Daiyu, her conduct was calm and courteous, her appearance graceful and refined. Everyone whispered that in certain respects, Daiyu could not compare. Even more, Baochai’s easy disposition won the hearts of the servants, whereas Daiyu’s aloof pride sometimes kept them at a distance. This disparity left Daiyu subtly resentful, though Baochai, oblivious, showed no sign of suspecting the cause. Baoyu, meanwhile, still a carefree child, adored all his sisters and cousins without distinction. Because he shared Grandmother Jia’s quarters with Daiyu, they had become closer than he was to anyone else. Yet such closeness inevitably led to the occasional outburst or misunderstanding.

Indeed, on an otherwise unremarkable day, Baoyu and Daiyu fell into a minor quarrel—the exact cause long since forgotten. Daiyu took offense, retiring to her room in tears. Baoyu soon regretted his harsh words, hurried to apologize, and gradually soothed her troubled heart.

2. A Nap in the Ning Mansion; Qin Keqing Arranges Baoyu’s Rest
Meanwhile, in the Ning Mansion garden, blossoms of plum were in full bloom. Lady You (Madame You) invited Grandmother Jia, Lady Xing, and Lady Wang, among others, to admire the flowers, setting a banquet in the Huifang Garden. In the morning, the guests assembled for a simple family celebration involving only members of the Ning and Rong households—no novel entertainment worthy of special note.

Partway through, Baoyu, feeling drowsy, asked permission to nap. Grandmother Jia commanded the servants to watch over him carefully until he awakened. Qin Shi, the wife of Jia Rong, quickly offered: “We’ve already prepared a room for Cousin Baoyu, so please don’t worry, Grandmother; leave him to me.” Knowing Qin Shi was gentle, skillful, and much favored among her great-granddaughters-in-law, Grandmother Jia readily consented.

So Qin Shi led a cluster of maidservants to the main house’s interior chamber. Baoyu glimpsed a painting on the wall, depicting the tale of “Reading by Oil Lamp,” and an accompanying couplet:

“All worldly affairs well understood is true learning;
Thorough insight into human relations is genuine literature.”
Baoyu found the message dour, the environment oppressive. Despite the elegant furnishings, he refused to stay. “Let’s go, let’s go!” he insisted. Qin Shi laughed, “Then come to my own room if you like.” A motherly nurse remonstrated, “What precedent is there for a nephew to sleep in his niece-in-law’s chambers?” Qin Shi responded with a smile, “He’s only a youngster; there’s no impropriety here. My brother’s the same age as Baoyu, if not taller.” Baoyu said eagerly, “I’d like to meet your brother someday.” Everyone laughed, but for now, they led him into Qin Shi’s personal quarters.

3. A Spell of Drowsiness in Qin Shi’s Perfumed Chamber
Entering the room, Baoyu was struck by an exquisite aroma and exclaimed, “Such fragrance!” He scanned the furnishings: a painting by Tang Bohu of “Spring Slumber Under the Crabapple,” flanked by a couplet by Song scholar Qin Taixu:

“A light chill locks the dream for spring is cold;
Lingering fragrance arouses the senses like wine’s bouquet.”
On the table, ornate mirrors, jade ornaments, and other curios evoked fantasies of ancient beauties and lovers. Baoyu exclaimed, “This is wonderful—just my kind of place!” Qin Shi quipped, “Even an immortal would feel at home here.” She then took out a sheer gauze quilt reputedly washed by Xi Shi and a pillow once reportedly embraced by Hongniang. Baoyu lay down comfortably, while the other attendants—Xiren, Qingwen, Sheyue, Qiuwen—stayed at hand. Qin Shi told her little maids to keep an eye on the cats and dogs outside, leaving the four senior maids to watch over Baoyu within.

Baoyu closed his eyes and drifted into a dream state. Dimly, he felt as though he were still with Qin Shi. Mistily, he followed her to a wondrous place: gleaming jade terraces, clear creeks, and lush foliage. No trace of human footprints, free from worldly clamor. Baoyu exulted, thinking, If only I could live here forever, beyond the control of parents and tutors!

From behind the hills came a maiden’s voice in song:

“A springtime dream, departing in fragments like scattered clouds,
Petals on the flowing water drifting away.
Thus I warn all youths—why seek sorrow without cause?”
Baoyu heard it was a girl’s voice. As the song died away, a radiant young woman emerged, graceful beyond earthly standards. A poetic description reads:

“Just parted from willow-shaded banks, stepping out of a bower of blossoms.
Birds in the courtyard fluttered away in alarm, her shadow passing beneath colonnaded corridors.
The soft flutter of silken sleeves carried the scent of musk and orchids.
Her hair was coiled in a cloudlike chignon pinned with jade,
Her cheeks glowed with the freshness of peach blossoms in spring,
Her lips opened like cherries, teeth glittering like pearls.
Her slender waist swayed as if dancing in drifting snow,
Her ornaments of gold and yellow shimmered at each step.
Sometimes she appeared amid flowers—playfully vexed or playfully pleased;
Or walking beside the streams—seeming to hover and soar.
Her brows showed faint distress, her feet slowed as if uncertain.
One glimpsed the purity of ice and jade in her bearing, the glimmer of precious gems in her robes.
Inherently so delicate and refined that any mortal would revere her.
Could she be a goddess from the Jade Pool? A fairy from the Purple Grotto?”
Overjoyed, Baoyu hurried to bow: “Divine maiden, from whence do you come, and where do you journey? I don’t even know where I am—please guide me.” The maiden smiled. “I live above the Plane of Distant Sorrows, amid the Sea of Abiding Grief, in Spring Let-Loose Mountain, the Fled Fragrance Grotto. I am the Fairy of Disenchantment (Jinghuan Xiangu), whose office is to govern mortal entanglements of moonlit passions and star-crossed romances—presiding over the debts incurred by longing men and grieving women. Recently I perceived strands of entangled fates here, so I came to stir thoughts of love. By chance, we meet—no random event. We stand just outside my home, where I harvest immortal tea, brew fine wine, maintain a few singing maidens, and have newly composed a twelve-part fairy ballad The Dream of the Red Chamber. Would you care to join me?” Baoyu, enraptured, forgot any earthly ties and followed her eagerly.

Soon they arrived before a monumental portal, inscribed with the words “Land of Illusion.” To either side of the archway ran a couplet:

“When the false is accepted as real, the real becomes false;
Where nothing exists, something arises—only to revert to nothing.”
Beyond lay a second gate labeled “Sea of Karma, Sky of Desire,” likewise graced with a couplet:

“High heaven and broad earth—who can gauge the endless entanglements of love?
Pitiable, the unrequited youth and grieving maiden—how settle the debts of passion?”
Baoyu pondered: So that’s the reason. But what exactly are these “passions of past and present,” and “debts of romance”? I shall observe and learn. Little did he know his curiosity already invited trouble. He continued with the fairy through the inner gates, passing corridors hung with plaques for various “offices”: Office of Infatuation, Office of Resentment, Office of Morning Tears, Office of Evening Lament, Office of Spring Heartache, Office of Autumn Sorrow. Baoyu asked excitedly, “Might I see each place in detail?” She replied, “These halls hold records of every woman’s past and future fate—mortal eyes cannot be permitted to see them all.” Baoyu’s curiosity remained fixed, so the Fairy of Disenchantment indulged him. “Fine,” she said, “we’ll wander a bit. But only a glimpse.”

Thus they entered a certain hall labeled “Registry of Doomed Beauties,” adorned with a couplet:

“Spring lament, autumn grief—brought on by oneself;
Flowerlike faces, moonlike grace—whom do they adorn?”
Inside stood ten-odd large cabinets, each sealed with official tags. Baoyu, scanning for his own province, discovered one marked “Jinling Twelve Beauties—Main Register,” and asked, “Why only twelve? Aren’t there hundreds, indeed thousands, of girls in Jinling? Our family alone has a few hundred girls.” The fairy laughed, “True, but we only record the most crucial. The next two cabinets are secondary. The rest—ordinary or unremarkable—remain unlisted.” Intrigued, Baoyu opened the “Supplementary” cabinet, removing a booklet labeled “Another Supplement.” Turning the first page, he saw neither human figures nor landscapes, just a swirl of ink depicting black clouds and a swirl of mist, accompanied by lines:

“A bright moon so rarely seen, tinted clouds easily dispersed;
Her spirit soared high as the heavens, her lot was base and humble.
Bewitching grace and cunning spark resentment,
A brief life ends amid slander and blame. A thoughtful young lord can only pine in vain.”
He found it perplexing. Another page showed vivid flowers alongside a tattered mat, with four lines:

“An empty gentleness and yielding grace,
Supposedly as fragrant as laurel, as pure as orchid.
What fortune has the favored entertainer?
The noble scion, after all, lacks fated ties.”
Still mystified, he replaced the volume, retrieving a second from the “Sub-Register.” The opening page showed a single blossom of cassia above a dried-up pond of lotus, with verse:

“Bound once to the lotus bloom, truly pitiful her life’s fate;
Long misfortune befell her, mournfully you see.
Though parted in two places, for lack of bridging roots,
A sweet soul returns to its native land.”
Next, he opened the “Main Register.” The first page displayed two withered trees, from whose branches hung a sash of jade; on the snowy ground below lay a gold hairpin. A quatrain read:

“Alas for the lady who paused her weaving,
Pity for her talent in verse.
Her jade girdle hangs in a forest glade,
Her golden pin lies buried in snow.”
Confused, Baoyu considered asking the fairy, but surmised she would not expose heaven’s secrets. Unwilling to discard the text but unable to grasp its meaning, he read on. Another page depicted a curved bow with a citron pinned to it, accompanied by:

“For twenty years, she sorted right from wrong,
The pomegranate bloom once glimmered within the palace walls.
Among three springs, none can surpass that first bright spring—
Yet when tigers meet rabbits, the dream soon fades away.”
And a further page depicted two figures adrift in a boat on a vast sea, a woman weeping within, accompanied by lines:

“Bright in intellect and lofty in spirit,
Yet born into a twilight age, with fortunes waning.
Gazing far across the river in tears,
A thousand li of east wind, a dream so distant still.”
Another picture showed drifting clouds and a rushing stream, with words:

“What use is wealth and power? She lost both parents while still in swaddling.
Even though reared in silks and gold, who grasps her secret tears?
Within a flash, youthful blossoms fall—no mention of bridal quilts or twin pillows.
Neither pearl coronet nor phoenix robe can conquer the inconstancy of life.”
Yet another showed a flawless piece of jade cast into muddy ground:

“Resolute in purity, how remain pure?
Emptiness above is not mere emptiness.
Alas for that golden-jade essence—
Mired at last in the mire.”
A further page showed a savage wolf pouncing upon a lovely maiden:

“He is but a wolf of Zhongshan,
Drunk with sudden success, he runs amok.
A noble flower of the gilded courtyard—
In a single year, lost to the dream of millet.”
Then a painting of an ancient temple, where a gentle maiden read sutras alone:

“She fathomed how quickly the three springs pass,
Abandoned her silks for monastic robes.
How pitiful, a marquis’s daughter raised in a tapestry house,
Alone now under a dim lamp in a monastic cell.”
Another page displayed a mighty glacier with a lone phoenix:

“A mortal bird arrives in an age’s end,
Each admires her graceful genius.
In thrice repeated lines, a story resonates—
Tears overshadow Jinling, intensifying her woe.”
Then a ruined inn in the wilderness, a woman at her loom:

“Once the tide of influence wanes, speak not of nobility;
When one’s home is lost, speak not of kin.
A chance rescue of a peasant wife—
Unexpectedly becomes her due.”
Next, a lush orchid in a pot, nearby a richly dressed woman in phoenix coronet and red cloak:

“In spring and summer, peach and plum have ripened;
Yet, who remains, but a single pot of orchids?
As water so pure becomes envy’s target,
She is scorned for her incomparable grace.”
Finally, a grand tower with a maiden hanging from the rafters:

“The realm of feelings runs deep, a realm of illusions,
A chance encounter of love leads to ruin.
Claim not that all worthless rogues stem from the Rong side;
Alas for seeds of strife in the Ning line.”
Baoyu yearned to probe deeper, but the Fairy of Disenchantment—aware of his quick mind yet worried about unveiling heaven’s secrets—promptly closed the booklet. “Better we wander on,” she said, “rather than let you brood over unknowable riddles.”

Half-reluctant, Baoyu abandoned the registers and followed the fairy to the rear. There, painted beams, carved eaves, jewel-hung curtains, and embroidered draperies shimmered among blossoms and exotic plants. A verse:

“Sunlit rails, golden-floored halls,
Snowy windows, jade-walled chambers.”
The fairy called, “Show yourselves—our guest has arrived!” At once, out came a score of young celestials in flowing gowns. Seeing Baoyu, they complained to the fairy, “We awaited that spirit of the Crimson Pearl—why bring this mortal, sullied creature to defile our pure feminine realm?” Baoyu blushed at such scorn, feeling grimy and inadequate. The fairy grasped his hand, explaining to her companions:

“You do not know. I was to meet the soul of the Crimson Pearl, but passing the Ning Mansion, the shades of Dukes Ning and Rong implored: ‘For a century now, from the founding of our dynasty, our family’s glory has flourished. But its course soon runs out, and we have no descendent to continue the legacy—save for our grandson Baoyu, whimsical by nature, half-bright, half-foolish. Yet he is clever enough that hope lingers, though the family’s fate nears its end. Fearing no one will guide him aright, we beg you to show him the illusions of passion, that he may awaken and choose the proper path.’ So, out of compassion, I drew him hither. He first perused the fates of certain ladies, yet remains unenlightened. That is why I’ve led him to see further illusions of indulgence—hoping he’ll achieve some insight.”
Taking Baoyu inside, she led him to a private chamber where he was assailed by a faint but entrancing perfume. He asked about the fragrance, and the fairy answered with a slight smile, “A scent unknown in the mortal realm—Essence of Fragrant Blossoms distilled from the oils of rare flora in magical peaks, fused with the sap of pearl trees.” Baoyu inhaled, marveling at its purity. They sat, and maidservants brought tea, also exuding a subtle taste. “This tea,” explained the fairy, “is gathered from the dew on fairy flowers within the Fled Fragrance Grotto, called ‘A Hundred Blooms in One Cup.’” Entranced, Baoyu nodded in delight, observing the room’s paintings, antiquities, and poems, as well as the cunning details of make-up boxes and cosmetics. The walls bore a couplet:

“A sanctuary of hidden wonders,
No force can invade such skies.”
Baoyu respectfully inquired after the fairy maidens’ names: some called themselves the Fairy of Pining Dreams, the Great Compassion for Passions, the Goldmaiden of Summoned Sorrow, the Bodhi of Relieving Hate. Before long, the maids arranged tables, set dishes of wine, each cup sparkling like glass. Baoyu tasted the fragrant liquor, so potent and transcendent he exclaimed, “What is this?” The fairy said, “It’s brewed from the dew of myriad flowers, from the marrow of kirin and phoenix milk, called ‘Myriad Beauties in One Cup.’” Baoyu sighed in admiration.

4. The Fairy Ballad: Dream of the Red Chamber
In the midst of the feast, twelve dancing girls came forth, inquiring which tunes to perform. The Fairy commanded, “Present the newly composed twelve pieces from The Dream of the Red Chamber.” The dancers bowed and began to strum slender lutes and lightly tap sandalwood clappers, singing:

1. Introduction
“When chaos first opened, who was fated for love?
All for the passion of wind and moon.
Alas for heaven—our wounded days, our lonely nights,
Let the fool’s heart speak.
Thus begins the lament of gold and mourning of jade:
The Dream of the Red Chamber.”
2. “Mistaken Lifetime”
“They all say it’s a perfect match of gold and jade—
While I cling to the memory of wood and stone.
Gazing at a recluse among the snowy peaks,
I cannot forsake the solitary fairy in the wild.
Earthly beauties, we see, lack perfection—now I know.
Even if husband and wife share a table in harmony,
The heart remains unsatisfied.”
3. “Vainly Misting the Brows”
“One’s a fairy blossom from Paradise,
The other a flawless jade.
If they had no destined bond, how did they meet again in this life?
But if they had a bond, why is their hope so hollow?
One sighs in vain, one pines in despair—
One is a moon in water, one a flower in a mirror.
How many tears can eyes produce,
Flowing from autumn through winter, then spring through summer?”
Seeing Baoyu mystified by the lyrics, which seemed more emotional than logical, the Fairy sighed, “He’s still unawakened.” Yet Baoyu, though confused, found the melodies hauntingly beautiful. So he set aside doubts and listened on:

4. “Resentment at Fate’s Fragility”
“Just when fortune shines, calamity intrudes.
All illusions crumble in a blink, souls lost amid drifting clouds.
We see those parted from home and kin, weeping,
Pleading in vain to the living: I’m gone; renounce your hopes.”
5. “Parting Flesh and Blood”
“Endless stormy roads, three thousand miles—
I leave my homeland, my family behind.
Weep not for me, dear father and mother.
Since olden times, all fate lies in the hidden spheres of destiny.
I shall part from you and pray for your well-being.
As I go, let us not be entangled further.”
6. “Joy Veiled by Sorrow”
“Orphaned in infancy, mother and father both lost.
Though reared in silken halls, who truly fathoms my plight?
Born so grand, with a broad mind, never tainted by petty desires.
Like a bright moon and gentle breeze that grace imperial halls,
Matched with a refined soul, a perfect union—
Eternal harmony, erasing that childhood of tribulation.
Yet illusions are ephemeral—clouds scatter, rivers dry.
Why lament what is ordained?”
7. “The World Cannot Tolerate”
“A nature fair as orchid, talent lofty as the immortals,
Confined by quirks of solitude—others rarely understand.
They think she scorns all feast and finery, that she loathes common pleasures.
Never suspect that the purer she is, the more envy she provokes,
The more condemnation from worldly tongues.
Alas, in some old temple she spends her final years,
Forsaking the red-lacquered mansion.
And at last, soiling her spotless jade in mortal dust.
Where is that noble suitor, that fated bond?”
8. “A Fateful Enemy”
“A wolf from Zhongshan, a beast without mercy,
Forgets all former kindness and indulges in lust.
Thus a noble house’s maiden is treated like lowly chaff;
Thus a prince’s cherished daughter sinks to dishonor.
Look how their lovely souls drift like restless phantoms.”
9. “Empty Flowers Understood”
“The three months of spring we read as illusions—
Peach blossoms and willow fronds, how can they truly endure?
Their brilliance soon fades into deeper loneliness.
Rhapsodies on peach blossoms overhead, apricots in the clouds,
But who sees them outlast the coming autumn?
White poplars moan in deserted graves,
Green maples wail in the wind,
All burying the charms of once-living souls.
For feast and power are illusions,
They vanish like blooms, so soon undone.
If you would escape this snare, look to the fabled Treasure Trees in the Western Realm.”
10. “The Burden of Wit”
“With every cunning scheme and lofty intellect,
She lost her very life.
Even while alive, her heart lay shattered;
A spirit unbound in death.
When her home was stable, she strove to preserve it;
When it crumbled, each fled his own way.
What use was half a lifetime of scheming,
Like a twilight dream soon to collapse?
Thundering like a colossal tower falling,
Flickering like a lamp nearly spent.
A fleeting joy turned to sorrow.
Woe to the fickle world!”
11. “Leaving Blessings Behind”
“Leaving behind our surplus grace,
Encountering a benefactor unexpectedly.
Thanks to Mother’s hidden virtue,
One escapes dire straits.
Let us offer hope to the needy, refrain from harshness,
Unlike those who hoard wealth and neglect kin—
Heaven above sees all, the final sum awaits.”
12. “Fleeting Prime”
“Reflected pleasures, illusions in mirrors and dreams—
Youthful vigor fades so swiftly.
Set aside thoughts of embroidered quilts and paired pillows.
Even wearing a pearl coronet and phoenix cloak cannot stall your last breath.
People say life must not end in old-age poverty,
Yet each must cultivate hidden virtue for children.
Boldly wearing official regalia, shining with rank,
Swiftly you near the final path.
Which generals or ministers ever truly endure?
Only vacant renown for posterity to admire.”
13. “Happy Times Conclude”
“Spring’s fragrance wanes, petals scattering from the rafters.
Beauty and wit can ruin a household.
Aristocratic heritage crumbles if not cherished,
Ancestral repute lost through folly.
All stems from a single root: feeling.”
14. “Like Birds Scattering to the Forest”
“Officials lose their estate, wealth dissolves into emptiness,
Meanwhile favored souls miraculously escape with their lives,
While cruel ones reap their due retribution.
Those who owe life repay life; those who owe tears shed tears;
Wrongs avenged in turn. Separation or reunion—foreordained.
For short or long destiny, look to former days.
If some grow rich in old age, perhaps they’re merely lucky.
The wise retire to monastic life, the confused die in vain—
Like birds that, having devoured their fill, retreat to the forest.
A blanket of pure white remains across a barren earth—clean and empty!”
When the ballad ended, the performers prepared a reprise, but the Fairy of Disenchantment, seeing Baoyu’s vacant reaction, dismissed them with a sigh: “Poor child, he’s not yet awakened.” Baoyu, feeling dazed, declared himself intoxicated and pleaded to lie down once more.

5. The Fairy Grants Baoyu an Erotic Lesson; His Frightening “Awakening”
The Fairy led him from the hall to a fragrant boudoir. Its lavish furnishings surpassed anything Baoyu had known, and inside waited a bewitching beauty—her face and figure reminiscent of both Baochai and Daiyu. Baoyu blushed, uncertain, but the Fairy spoke:

“In mortal wealthy houses, silken windows, scented nights, all are wasted on lecherous fops and wanton maidens. Their behavior is truly shameful. Worse, many a lustful youth cloaks his vice as ‘appreciating beauty without debauchery’—merely masking base instincts with high-sounding phrases. But you, child, are different. You are endowed with a single-minded passion known as ‘sentimental desire’ (yi yin)—not the coarse, physical type. Yet in the eyes of the worldly, that is but an eccentric perversity, attracting a thousand scorns and a million glares. On behalf of your ancestors, I have led you here, to intoxicate you with rare wine, enlighten you with mystic songs, and now bestow upon you the secret knowledge of cloud and rain. You shall taste it with my younger sister—she is Called Jianmei, styled Keqing. Tonight, fulfill this union. Then you will see that even a fleeting illusion in these fairy lands is wondrous. If mundane illusions prove so enthralling, how much more so the real world? From henceforth, remember our instruction, apply yourself to Confucian virtue, and devote yourself to practical statecraft.”
So saying, she imparted to Baoyu the ways of sexual intimacy and pushed him inside the chamber, shutting the door. In a dreamlike stupor, Baoyu followed the Fairy’s teachings. He and Keqing engaged in that “male-female exchange,” indescribable in its details. By dawn, their affections deepened, entangled in languorous tenderness. Hand in hand, they strolled beyond the palace walls and came to a place of brambles and wild beasts, blocked by a dark torrent, with no bridge in sight. Alarmed, they paused, and the Fairy rushed forward: “Stop, go no further! Turn back at once!” Baoyu cried, “Where are we?” The Fairy answered, “This is the Ford of Illusion, a bottomless gulf spanning a thousand li, with only a lone raft guided by the Wooddweller and the Ashservant. They take no coin, ferrying only the fated. Another step, and you might plunge into its depths, breaking my earnest warnings.” Hardly had she spoken when thunderous roars echoed from the black water, monstrous demons hauling Baoyu downward. Terrified, drenched in sweat, he screamed, “Keqing, save me!” and in the real world, his cries rang out.

6. Baoyu’s Startling Outcry; Qin Shi’s Wonder
Back in Qin Shi’s room, the startled maids sprang to Baoyu’s side, clutching him: “Don’t fear, we’re here!” In his dream, Baoyu shouted Qin Shi’s personal name—though no one at the mansion had mentioned it. Outside, Qin Shi herself was instructing servants to watch the pets, and upon hearing her own childhood name from Baoyu’s lips, she gasped: “How does he know my pet name? Even in dreams, he calls it!”

But the meaning behind this curious slip remains a mystery, to be revealed only in the next chapter.
Chapter 6
Baoyu Tastes the Pleasures of Cloud and Rain for the First Time;
Granny Liu Makes Her First Visit to the Rong Mansion

In the previous chapter, Qin Shi overheard Baoyu speaking her childhood name in his dream and grew curious, yet found it awkward to ask him directly. Meanwhile, Baoyu awakened in a half-dazed state, as though missing something. Rising to straighten his clothes, he motioned for Xiren to help re-tie his trousers; but when her hand reached his thigh, she felt a cold, clammy dampness. Startled, she quickly withdrew her hand and asked, “What’s this?” Baoyu blushed and pinched her hand in reply.

Xiren, though only two years older than Baoyu, was bright and perceptive, and lately she was beginning to understand such matters. Sensing what might have happened, she blushed deeply and refrained from further questions. She tidied his clothes and followed him to Grandmother Jia’s quarters, where they had supper rather absentmindedly. Then, once they returned to their own side of the house—and the nurses and maids were out of earshot—Xiren took out a fresh undergarment for Baoyu to change into.

He blushed, pleading, “Please, dear sister, don’t mention this to anyone.” Xiren, her face reddening, asked with a sly smile, “But how did you get that dampness… where exactly did it come from?” Baoyu merely turned redder and said nothing. Xiren looked at him, half amused, half bashful. After a time, Baoyu confessed his dream in detail: how in that fantasy he’d experienced a moment of secret union, an erotic entanglement. Hearing his account, Xiren hid her face, laughing so hard she bent forward.

Baoyu, having already admired Xiren’s gentle, appealing charms, seized this chance to press her toward the intimacy that Fairy Disenchantment had taught him in the dream. Xiren knew Grandmother Jia had personally assigned her to Baoyu’s service, so there was no escaping it. She resisted for a time, but eventually, forced by circumstance, yielded to his demands. Henceforth, Baoyu showed Xiren even greater favor, and Xiren, for her part, became more devoted and conscientious.

Thus we leave that story behind and turn to the many trivial affairs of the Rong Mansion, which, in sum, houses over three hundred souls. Each day brings twenty minor events, tangled like a skein of thread—how best to find a single thread to start our narrative? As it happens, from hundreds of miles away, an inconsequential household with a slight connection to the Rong Mansion was about to arrive for a visit. Let us use that as our opening.

1. Granny Liu and Her Family’s Plight
This small family’s surname was Wang, from the local region. Their forebear once held a minor official post in the capital and became acquainted with the father of Lady Wang (mother of Wang Xifeng and sister of Lady Wang in the Rong Mansion). Eager for advantage, that forebear contrived to join the clan as a “distant nephew.” In that generation, only Lady Wang’s eldest brother (Wang Xifeng’s father) and Lady Wang herself, who were then in the capital, knew of this tie. Others never learned.

Time passed, that older generation died, leaving one sole descendant, Wang Cheng. As fortunes waned, he left the city for the countryside. Wang Cheng also passed away, and his son, nicknamed Gou’er (“Puppy”), took a wife of the Liu family. They had a son, nicknamed Ban’er (“Plank”), and a daughter, Qing’er. The family of four subsisted by farming. Gou’er worked in the fields, his wife handled household chores—fetching water, milling grain—while the two children roamed about. Feeling the strain, Gou’er invited his mother-in-law, an old widow called Granny Liu, to come help mind the children. This elderly lady, having lost her husband with no sons to provide for her, had survived on two mu of poor farmland. Relieved that her son-in-law would now support her, she settled there.

Autumn had ended and winter was nigh. The family needed supplies, but they had no money. In frustration, Gou’er drank some wine, grew surly, and shouted at his wife, who dared not respond. Granny Liu, witnessing this, intervened:

“Son-in-law, don’t be angry if I speak plainly. We country folk must live within our means—whatever size bowl we have, that’s what we fill. As a child, you had your father and mother’s support, so you got used to easy living. Now, when you have a bit of money, you spend it heedlessly, and when you haven’t any, you lash out—what kind of man does that make you? Our hut stands close enough to the capital: the Emperor’s city is brimming with money, only we haven’t learned how to scoop it up. Kicking around the house in a rage won’t solve anything!”
Gou’er sneered, “You’re just babbling from your spot on the kang—are you telling me to go rob people?”

She replied, “Who said robbing? We must find a plan. The silver won’t walk to our door on its own, will it? I can think of one opportunity: many years ago, your father’s grandfather connected our line to that formidable Wang clan. Twenty years back, they still recognized our family. But we pulled away out of pride, so the bond faded. Remember, I once visited them with your wife. Their second young lady—very forthright, not the least arrogant—now she’s Lady Wang in the Rong Mansion. Word is that she’s grown older, more compassionate toward the poor, often giving alms. The official Wang clan advanced in rank, but that second lady might recall us. So why don’t you all pay a call? Maybe she’ll remember old times and help. Even a single favor from that household would be an enormous boon for us.”

Gou’er’s wife, Liu Shi, objected: “Think of our ragged clothes and wretched faces. We can hardly walk up to their gate. Even the doormen might mock us.”

But Gou’er’s mind had latched onto the idea: “I covet wealth and reputation. If there’s any chance, we should try. You, mother-in-law, did once meet that mistress. So how about you head in first, see what they say? If we men showed up like this, we’d only bring shame. And if my wife—who’s still young—went, that would be awkward too. Best if you, older and more experienced, go test the waters. If it turns out well, we’ll all benefit.”

Granny Liu balked: “Ah, that’s a bit rash. As they say, ‘A marquis’s gate is deeper than the sea.’ I’m nothing. The doormen won’t even know me. I’d walk all that way in vain.”

Gou’er retorted, “I have a plan. Bring Ban’er along. Head first to your old friend, Master Zhou the steward. If you find him, that’s our ‘in.’ Years ago, he helped my father settle a land dispute, so we were on quite good terms.”

Thus they debated through the evening, finalizing their scheme.

Before dawn, Granny Liu rose, washed, rehearsed Ban’er in a few polite lines, then set out for the city. Ban’er, just five or six, was thrilled to visit the capital. They reached Ning-Rong Street and paused before the imposing front gates of the Rong Mansion, flanked by giant stone lions. Seized by awe, Granny Liu dusted her clothes, instructed Ban’er again, then sidled toward the side gate. Several porters and gatekeepers lounged about, gesticulating and chatting. Approaching, she offered them a respectful greeting: “Honorable masters, good day!”

They eyed her dully, one eventually asking, “Who are you, and what do you want?”

She replied, “I’m here to see Steward Zhou the steward in Lady Wang’s household. May I trouble one of you to let him know?”

They regarded her with no interest, and after a while one said, “Go wait by that corner. Maybe someone inside will come out eventually.” Among them, an older man added, “Why keep her waiting here? It’s not so urgent. But if it’s Zhou, he’s away to the south. His wife is in the back quarters. She’s called Zhou Damei or Zhou Da—well, anyway. You could try the back gate.”

Granny Liu thanked him and led Ban’er around to the rear entrance, seeing hawkers and peddlers with baskets, plus two or three dozen children noisily running about. She asked one lad, “Nephew, could you direct me to the home of Dame Zhou?”

He rolled his eyes: “Which Dame Zhou? We have a bunch of them. Which section does she belong to?”

“She’s the Lady’s personal attendant,” said Granny Liu.

The boy said, “Oh, that’s simple. Follow me.”

He led her through a courtyard to a side compound. Pointing to a certain gate, he called, “Dame Zhou, an old lady’s here to see you!”

A middle-aged woman emerged to greet them. Recognizing the visitor, she said, “Why, Granny Liu? Is that you? It’s been so long I almost forgot. Do come inside.”

Granny Liu, smiling, replied, “Zhou sister, you’re a ‘busy lady with an easy memory to lose track of folks’—of course you wouldn’t recall the likes of me!”

Zhou Rui’s wife brought her into a small sitting room, and a maid served them tea. They exchanged pleasantries, inquiring about each other’s families. Finally, Zhou Rui’s wife asked, “Did you come specifically or just happen to pass by?”

Granny Liu answered, “I specially came to see you, but also to pay my respects to Lady Wang. If you could help me see her, that would be splendid; if not, I’d ask you to deliver my respects on my behalf.”

Zhou Rui’s wife guessed her errand, recalling an old favor from Gou’er’s father years before. Also, wanting to display her own “connections,” she said with a laugh, “Granny, worry not. If you come all this way so sincerely, how could I not take you in to see the household? Granted, we have our protocols—my husband deals with farmland rents and escorting young masters out, while I handle the lady’s outings. But you’re Lady Wang’s kin, and you came to me, so let me break a small rule. I’ll go inside and announce you. One point though: times have changed since five years ago. Nowadays, Lady Wang seldom manages affairs, leaving everything to the second mistress—our Mistress Lian, known as Young Mistress Feng, her niece. The entire mansion’s day-to-day matters pass through her. She’s the big mistress these days. If you want an audience, it’ll be with her. Actually, this might be better for you. Let me find the right moment.”

Granny Liu heaped thanks on her, insisting, “We entrust everything to your kindness, Sister Zhou,” to which Zhou Rui’s wife replied, “No need for all that. As the saying goes, ‘Give convenience to others and you yourself enjoy convenience.’ Just a word from me. It costs me nothing.”

She summoned a maid: “Go to the side hall and quietly check if the Old Madam’s meal is served.” The maid left, leaving Granny Liu and Zhou Rui’s wife chatting. Granny Liu said, “So this Feng mistress can’t be more than eighteen or nineteen, but she’s running the entire household? Quite remarkable!”

Zhou Rui’s wife replied, “Truly remarkable. She’s as beautiful as a flower in full bloom and has a mind sharper than most men. If she starts reasoning, not even ten seasoned talkers can out-talk her! She’s lively and strong-willed, except she’s sometimes strict with us servants.”

Soon, the maid returned, saying, “They’ve set the Old Madam’s table. Mistress Lian is currently in Lady Wang’s quarters.” Zhou Rui’s wife sprang up, “We must hurry. Once they’re at table, we lose our chance. After lunch, they’ll rest or handle other business.”

She pulled Granny Liu and Ban’er along, winding through corridors until they reached a small side hall. “Wait here,” she told them, “and I’ll see if the mistress is free.” She crossed an inner courtyard to find Mistress Feng’s personal maid—Ping’er. Zhou Rui’s wife confided Granny Liu’s background and request: “They’re here to see Lady Wang, but as you know, everything nowadays is channeled through Mistress Feng. This old granny is truly in difficulty. If Mistress Feng could spare a moment, it’d be a great kindness.” Ping’er, after hearing the details, said, “Then have them wait inside. When Mistress Feng steps away from the Old Madam’s lunch, I’ll mention it.”

Zhou Rui’s wife relayed this message to Granny Liu, bringing her into a bright, well-furnished room. Under the eaves outside, a maid parted a crimson felt curtain to let them enter. At once a heady fragrance enveloped them, making Granny Liu feel as though she walked on clouds. Every object shone, reflecting light so brilliantly that she grew dizzy, left only to mutter prayers under her breath. Zhou Rui’s wife guided them into the east side chamber, where Ping’er and another woman were seated on the kang. Ban’er and Granny Liu were invited up to sit as well, and tea was served.

Granny Liu noticed a strange clattering, somewhat like a sieve. She glanced around, spotting a small box hung from a central pillar with a heavy weight beneath it, rocking to and fro. She wondered, What contraption is that? Suddenly, it gave a series of loud clangs, like bronze gongs. Startled, Granny Liu nearly jumped.

A servant dashed in: “Mistress Feng is on her way down!” Ping’er and Zhou Rui’s wife rose at once, hurrying out. Granny Liu surmised that the clangs signaled the mistress’s approach. Meanwhile, footsteps and voices filled the courtyard. Servants scattered in all directions with plates and dishes, presumably clearing away lunch. A few minutes later, silence fell.

Ping’er returned and beckoned: “All right, come with me.” Granny Liu and Ban’er followed her to the main room. Outside hung a splendid red-embroidered hanging. Beyond it stood a heated kang (brick platform) with a plush red carpet. At the eastern end, a locked, embroidered backrest and pillow sat on top of a gold-threaded seat mat, with a silver spittoon at one side. On that kang, enthroned in everyday garments—a purple sable hairpiece, a pearl-trimmed headband, a peach-red patterned jacket, a stone-blue cloak with braided squirrel lining, and a bright red foreign-silk skirt with silver-mouse trim—sat Wang Xifeng, more widely known as Mistress Feng or “Fengjie.” Radiant and regal, she was methodically stirring the coals in a hand-warmer with a small copper poker. Ping’er stood by, holding a small lacquered tray with a covered teacup.

Wang Xifeng neither rose nor looked up, continuing to stir the embers. She said casually, “So why haven’t you asked them in yet?” As she raised her head for tea, she saw Zhou Rui’s wife already bringing Granny Liu and Ban’er in. Hastily, she half-started to get up, wearing a bright smile, and exclaimed with warmth, “Why didn’t you tell me sooner!”

Granny Liu promptly dropped to her knees, bowing multiple times and addressing Feng as “Honored Aunt.” Waving, Wang Xifeng said, “Zhou sister, help her up. I’m young; I’m not sure of our exact family connection—nor dare I accept the term ‘aunt.’” Zhou Rui’s wife introduced them: “This is that very old Granny Liu I mentioned.” Feng nodded, letting Granny Liu sit near the kang’s edge. Ban’er peeked out from behind her, but refused all coaxing to step forward and bow.

Wang Xifeng said with a laugh, “We seldom see our relatives. One might think you resent us, unwilling to drop by. Outsiders might say we’re too haughty to welcome you.” Granny Liu hastened to say, “We’re poor folks, not fit to walk through such grand gates. Even your doormen see our shabby faces as a joke.”

Feng laughed: “Oh, that’s nonsense—our grandeur is mere show. ‘A scrawny camel is still bigger than a horse,’ as they say, but truly, we’re only propped up by our forefathers’ empty fame. Let’s not dwell on that.” Then she asked Zhou Rui’s wife, “Have you informed Lady Wang yet?”

Zhou Rui’s wife replied, “I waited for your instructions.”

Feng told her, “Go see if Lady Wang is free. If she’s busy, you can pass on word and see what she suggests.” Zhou Rui’s wife left. Feng turned to Granny Liu: “Here, child, have some fruit,” handing a piece to Ban’er. She inquired after a few trifles, but then a cluster of stewards and maids hurried over with household affairs. Feng said, “I’m receiving a guest. Let’s handle these matters later. If anything urgent arises, Ping’er can come fetch me.”

Ping’er went out, then returned: “No pressing business. I told them all to disperse.” Feng nodded. Presently, Zhou Rui’s wife returned. “Lady Wang says she’s busy now; if it’s just a social visit, that’s fine, but if there’s something to discuss, let Mistress Feng take care of it.” Granny Liu quickly interjected, “There’s no big matter—just paying respects. We’re distant kin, so I thought we shouldn’t remain strangers.”

Zhou Rui’s wife said, “Yes, if you have anything to say, speak to Mistress Feng. It’s the same as telling Lady Wang.” She shot Granny Liu a knowing glance. At once, Granny Liu flushed. She had come precisely to seek help, but overcame her reluctance to mention it. Nervously, she stammered, “We arrived from far away, so… well… it’s not exactly proper to mention the first time we meet, but—”

Before she could finish, a page announced from the second gate, “Young Master Rong from the Ning Mansion is here.” Feng said, “Enough; hold that thought. … Where is that boy? Oh, there he is.” In strode a handsome youth of about seventeen, face fair, figure slender, clad in sumptuous attire—this was Jia Rong, son of Jia Zhen in the Ning branch. Granny Liu, feeling more awkward, tried to stand or hide. Feng laughed, “No need to move. He’s my nephew.”

Jia Rong greeted her, then said smiling, “My father sent me, Aunt, to borrow the glass screen from your father-in-law’s sister. Tomorrow, we’re hosting an important guest at home, and Father wanted to borrow it for display.”

Feng teased, “Too late. I just lent it out yesterday.” Jia Rong half knelt at the kang’s edge: “Aunt, please don’t turn me away! Father says if I come back empty-handed, I’ll be scolded. Good Aunt, have pity!”

Feng teased, “Always you see something from the Wang side, you want to borrow it. Don’t you have enough treasure in your own storehouses?” Jia Rong beamed, “Aunt, please relent!” Finally, she said, “If you so desire it, handle it with care—don’t chip it. Ping’er, bring the storeroom key and have a few reliable men help.” Jia Rong’s face lit with relief, “I’ll go personally to ensure no damage.” Off he went.

Suddenly remembering something, Feng called him back: “Rong, wait… oh never mind. Come by after dinner.” Jia Rong answered, “Yes, Aunt,” and retreated with a knowing grin.

Granny Liu, seeing that Jia Rong’s interruption had ended, tried again: “I… I came with my grandson, because my son-in-law’s household lacks even food. The weather’s getting cold, so I ventured to come find you, dear Aunt…” She fumbled. Feng, quick to sense her meaning, smiled: “No need to say more, I understand. We do share a tie, so we shouldn’t have waited for you to come. But truly, the older generation is preoccupied, and I myself scarcely know all our extended kin. Outsiders see our mansion’s bustle but don’t realize the difficulties. Still, you’ve come all this way for the first time—how could I let you return empty-handed? By luck, Lady Wang gave me twenty taels of silver to make new clothes for my maids, and I haven’t used it yet. Take it for the children’s winter clothes. Next time, come by again. That’s what kinship is about. It’s growing late, so I won’t keep you. Say hello to all at home.”

Astounded, Granny Liu accepted the bag of silver. She was so delighted she exclaimed, “You folks may be tight, but to us, ‘A single hair from your body is thicker than our waist!’” She babbled on in rustic idioms. Zhou Rui’s wife winced at her crude words, trying to signal her to hush, but Feng only smiled as though she hadn’t noticed. Then, stepping aside, she instructed Ping’er to bring a string of copper coins for them as well.

Thanking her profusely, Granny Liu followed Zhou Rui’s wife outside, who apologized in a low voice, “My dear granny, you seemed all flustered in front of Mistress Feng, calling Ban’er ‘her nephew!’ She calls the Ning Mansion’s young master her nephew, so how can Ban’er also be her nephew? Anyway, it’s fine, you did get the help you came for.” Granny Liu said, “Sister, I was so overwhelmed by her presence, I hardly knew what I said.” Zhou Rui’s wife took her back to her own quarters, where Granny Liu wanted to leave a small piece of silver for the children there. Zhou Rui’s wife politely refused.

Departing at last, Granny Liu and Ban’er slipped out the back gate.

2. Granny Liu’s Departure and Aftermath
Thus Granny Liu headed home, her purpose achieved beyond expectation, bearing silver and coin for the family’s relief. A minor figure, but her visit provided an essential thread in our tapestry of the mansion’s affairs. Yet what would unfold in her humble household thereafter? We must leave that for another chapter.

Here, Mistress Feng, after dispatching Granny Liu, returned to her daily routine. The house’s endless matters—managing servants, receiving guests, handling storehouse records—demanded her immediate attention. Time pressed on, but that is a story for future telling.
Chapter 7

Sending Palace Flowers, Jia Lian Teases Wang Xifeng;
At a Banquet in the Ning Mansion, Baoyu Encounters Qin Zhong

When Zhou Rui’s wife finished escorting Granny Liu away, she went upstairs to report back to Lady Wang. However, Lady Wang was not in her main quarters; asking a few maids, she learned that Lady Wang had gone to chat with Aunt Xue. Hearing this, Zhou Rui’s wife exited through the east corner gate, passed through the eastern compound, and made her way to Pear Fragrance Court. Reaching the courtyard entrance, she saw Lady Wang’s maid, Jin Chuan, along with a newly coifed young girl, both standing on the steps amusing themselves. Spotting Zhou Rui’s wife entering, they realized she had something to report, so they motioned with their lips toward the interior.

Zhou Rui’s wife lifted the curtain lightly and went in, seeing Lady Wang and Aunt Xue deep in a lengthy discussion about household matters and personal connections. Not wishing to interrupt, she proceeded into the adjoining inner room. There she saw Xue Baochai, simply dressed, her hair in a casual bun, leaning over a small desk with her maid, Ying’er, tracing flower patterns. On noticing Zhou Rui’s wife, Baochai put down her brush, turned around, and with a broad smile said, “Sister Zhou, please sit.” Zhou Rui’s wife hurriedly returned the smile, inquired after Baochai’s health, then sat on the edge of the heated platform. She remarked, “It’s been two or three days since we last saw you come over. I wonder if your dear ‘Brother Bao’ might have somehow offended you?” Baochai laughed. “Certainly not. I’ve just had a flare-up of my old complaint, so I’ve stayed quiet for a couple of days.” Zhou Rui’s wife said, “Indeed. Young lady, what exactly is the root of your illness? It would be best to find a proper doctor soon. It’s no trivial matter to be so young and stuck with a chronic complaint.” Hearing this, Baochai smiled and said, “Let’s not discuss this illness again! Who knows how many physicians we’ve tried, how many medications we’ve consumed, how much money we’ve spent, yet without a trace of benefit. Eventually, it was thanks to a certain monk who specializes in nameless ailments. We called him to examine me, and he claimed it was a heat-toxin carried from the womb—fortunately my constitution is sturdy, so it’s not serious. But for me to take ordinary prescriptions would do no good. He then recommended a ‘transoceanic fairy remedy’ and gave me a small packet of powdered medicine as a catalyst—it has a peculiar fragrance. He said that if my symptoms flare up, taking one pill would suffice. Strangely enough, it seems to work.”

Zhou Rui’s wife asked, “Which remedy is that? If you tell me, I can keep it in mind, so if we encounter anyone else with the same affliction, we can do a good deed by sharing it.” Baochai laughed. “Best not to ask. Bringing it up only heaps trouble on oneself. The ingredients themselves are hardly remarkable; the real difficulty lies in that phrase ‘if by chance...’ We need twelve ounces each of the stamens from springtime white peonies, summertime white lotuses, autumn white hibiscus, and winter white plum blossoms. Then, on the day of the following spring equinox, these must be dried in the sun, combined with that powdered medicine, and ground together. Next, we must collect rainwater on the day of Rain Water, precisely twelve qian—” Zhou Rui’s wife interrupted with a laugh, “Goodness me, that alone would take three years, wouldn’t it? And if no rain falls on Rain Water, what then?” Baochai chuckled, “Exactly. How can we guarantee rain on that specific day? We’d just have to wait for another year. Then we also need a dozen qian each of dew from White Dew, frost from Frost’s Descent, and snow from Light Snow. We blend these four waters thoroughly, form the mixture into pellets the size of longan fruits, place them in an old porcelain jar, and bury it under the flower roots. If I fall ill, I take one pellet, swallowing it with a decoction of one qian and two fen of yellow cypress. Then all is well.” Zhou Rui’s wife exclaimed, “Mercy, what a maddening coincidence of details! Ten years might go by without managing them all!” Baochai said, “Exactly so. Once that monk departed, it took me a year or two, slowly gathering it all, finally managing to complete one batch. I brought it with me from home, and now it’s buried beneath the pear tree. If I get wheezy or short of breath, I take a pellet and that’s the end of it.” Zhou Rui’s wife added, “Does this medicine have a name?” Baochai replied, “Yes. The monk gave it a name: ‘Cold Fragrance Pills.’” At that, Zhou Rui’s wife nodded. She pressed again, “When your illness flares, what exactly happens?” Baochai responded, “It’s not much, only some coughing and panting. After swallowing one pellet, it subsides.”

While they were talking, they heard Lady Wang call from outside, “Who’s in there?” Zhou Rui’s wife hurriedly stepped out and reported on Granny Liu’s matter. She waited half a moment, and seeing Lady Wang had no other instructions, was about to withdraw when Aunt Xue suddenly smiled, “Hold on. I have something; you may as well take it along.” With that, she called, “Xiangling!” The curtain rustled, and that little girl who had been playing with Jin Chuan just now stepped inside, asking, “Madam, what do you need?” Aunt Xue told her, “Bring the flowers from that box.” Xiangling complied, going over to fetch a small embroidered casket. Aunt Xue said, “These are newly made palace-style layered gauze ornaments—twelve of them in total. Yesterday, I remembered them and realized it was a shame to leave them to grow stale, so why not let the young ladies wear them? I was about to send them over yesterday but happened to forget. You arrived in time, so take them back. Your three young ladies at home get two each, leaving six. Give Lin Daiyu two and the last four to Sister Feng.” Lady Wang objected, “We might keep them for dear Bao, but you’re also thinking of the others.” Aunt Xue answered, “My dear in-law, you’re unaware that our dear Bao seldom fancies these floral, powdery things.”

So Zhou Rui’s wife carried the little box, left the room, and saw Jin Chuan still basking in the sun. Zhou Rui’s wife asked, “Is that little maid Xiangling truly the one I keep hearing about—the girl purchased before coming to the capital, the one whose situation led to a homicide lawsuit?” Jin Chuan replied, “Indeed, that’s the one.” Just then Xiangling came by all smiles. Zhou Rui’s wife took her hand, examined her closely, then said to Jin Chuan, “Her features carry a certain resemblance to that young mistress, the wife of Jia Rong in the East Mansion.” “I said the same,” Jin Chuan responded. Zhou Rui’s wife asked Xiangling, “How old were you when you came here? Where are your parents? What is your age now, and which province are you originally from?” Xiangling shook her head, replying, “I don’t remember.” Hearing this, Zhou Rui’s wife and Jin Chuan both sighed, lamenting for a while.

Zhou Rui’s wife then carried the flowers to the rear of Lady Wang’s main quarters. Lately, Grandmother Jia had remarked that with too many granddaughters in one place, it got crowded. She kept Baoyu and Lin Daiyu with her, but moved Yingchun, Tanchun, and Xichun to three rear rooms behind Lady Wang’s side so they could have a bit more space, with Li Wan watching over them. Zhou Rui’s wife took advantage of that arrangement to stop by. There in the veranda, she saw a few young maids sitting quietly, waiting for orders. Yingchun’s maid, Siqi, and Tanchun’s maid, Shishu, had just lifted the curtain, each carrying trays of teacups. Guessing the two sisters were together, Zhou Rui’s wife also went inside. She saw Yingchun and Tanchun near the window, playing Go. Zhou Rui’s wife presented the flowers, explaining the reason, and both young ladies paused their game, stood partially to show politeness, and had their maids put the flowers away.

Zhou Rui’s wife then said, “Fourth Young Lady isn’t in her room, I suppose she must be at the Old Madam’s place?” Some maids replied, “Isn’t she in that other room?” So Zhou Rui’s wife went in that direction. There she found Xichun playing around with the young novice from the Water Moon Nunnery, named Zhinen. Seeing Zhou Rui’s wife enter, Xichun asked what she wanted. Zhou Rui’s wife opened the box of flowers and explained. Xichun laughed, “I was just telling Zhinen that tomorrow I plan to shave my head and become a nun with her. Now these flowers arrive—if I shave my head, where am I supposed to pin them?” Everyone shared a bit of fun. Xichun told her maid to store them. Zhou Rui’s wife then asked Zhinen, “When did you arrive? Where has your tonsured master gone?” Zhinen answered, “We arrived early this morning. My master visited Lady Wang, then left for Master Yu’s household, telling me to wait here.” Zhou Rui’s wife then asked, “Have you received the monthly allotment for incense money, due by the fifteenth?” Zhinen said, “I’m not sure.” Xichun turned to Zhou Rui’s wife: “At present, who’s in charge of paying monthly allocations to the temples?” Zhou Rui’s wife answered, “Yu Xin handles that.” Xichun gave a small smile. “Yes, that explains it. Once her master arrived, Yu Xin’s wife must have come running and whispered with her for half the day—surely about that matter.”

After a moment of chatting, Zhou Rui’s wife headed off toward Wang Xifeng’s apartments. She crossed a narrow passageway behind Li Wan’s windows, went by the western garden wall, out the west corner gate, and entered Xifeng’s courtyard. Reaching the main hall, she found a maid named Feng’er sitting on the threshold, who motioned for her to go to the east side. Understanding the signal, Zhou Rui’s wife tiptoed around to the eastern room. Inside, she saw the wet nurse trying to lull the young daughter to sleep. Zhou Rui’s wife quietly asked, “Is Second Mistress napping? She’s likely awake by now.” The wet nurse smiled, pursed her lips, and shook her head. At that moment, they heard a faint laugh from the other side—clearly Jia Lian’s voice. Then the door creaked open, and Ping’er emerged with a large brass basin, calling for water. She stepped into the side room, saw Zhou Rui’s wife, and inquired, “What brings you here?” Zhou Rui’s wife stood and presented a small box. “I’m delivering these flowers.” Ping’er examined them, selected four, and slipped away. A short while later she returned with two in her hand. Summoning a maid named Cai Ming, she instructed, “Take these over to the other mansion for young Mrs. Rong to wear.” Then she allowed Zhou Rui’s wife to withdraw, telling her to express thanks on her behalf.

Thus, Zhou Rui’s wife finally proceeded to Grandmother Jia’s quarters. Passing through a small hall, she suddenly spotted her daughter, dressed in her married attire, who had just come from her in-laws. Zhou Rui’s wife hastily asked, “What are you doing here now?” Her daughter replied, “Mother, how is your health lately? I waited at home half the day for you. You never arrived. What could be so pressing? I got tired of waiting and went to pay respects to the Old Madam, and now I’m off to greet Lady Wang. Do you still have more tasks undone? And what are you holding in your hands?” Zhou Rui’s wife smiled. “Ah! Today by coincidence, that Granny Liu showed up, and I busied myself a good half-day on her behalf. Then, as soon as Aunt Xue spotted me, she gave me these few branches of flowers to deliver to the young ladies. I still haven’t finished. You must have some business, coming all the way here.” Her daughter laughed, “You’re a shrewd guesser, as always. Indeed, I do. To speak plainly, after your son-in-law drank too much wine the other day, he got into an argument. Next thing we know, someone set a strange fire, claiming he has no legitimate background, and the rumor is he’ll be dispatched back to our hometown for questioning. That’s why I came to consult with you, hoping you can ask a favor from someone. Do you know whom we can approach to settle it quickly?” Zhou Rui’s wife responded, “I suspected it might be something like this. But that’s hardly serious. Calm yourself. Go on home first. I must finish delivering Miss Lin’s flowers before returning. Lady Wang and Second Mistress are busy right now. I’ll mention it tonight; that’s all it will take.” Hearing that, her daughter said farewell, still reminding her mother, “Please do hurry, though.” Zhou Rui’s wife sighed. “Yes, yes—young people who’ve never seen trouble get so frantic.” She then proceeded to Lin Daiyu’s room.

Unexpectedly, Lin Daiyu was not in her own quarters but in Baoyu’s rooms. They, along with some maids, were puzzling over the nine-linked rings. Entering, Zhou Rui’s wife smiled. “Miss Lin, Aunt Xue asked me to bring these flowers to you.” Baoyu spoke up, “What flowers? Let me see!” Reaching out, he opened the box, discovering two newly styled palace gauze flowers. Daiyu, merely glancing at them in Baoyu’s hands, asked, “Are these only for me alone, or have the other girls already received theirs?” Zhou Rui’s wife replied, “They each got theirs as well. These two are meant for you.” Daiyu gave a cold laugh. “I already guessed as much—if there hadn’t been any left, I’d not get a single one.” Zhou Rui’s wife, hearing this, dared not speak. Baoyu asked, “Sister Zhou, what took you over there?” So Zhou Rui’s wife recounted, “I went to see Lady Wang, who was talking with Aunt Xue. She took the chance to have me deliver these.” Baoyu said, “What’s our dear Baochai doing at home? Why hasn’t she come over these past few days?” Zhou Rui’s wife answered, “She’s not feeling well.” Baoyu then told the maids, “Who can go check on her? Tell her Sister Lin and I send our regards. Ask what her illness is, and what she’s taking. By rights, I should go myself, but I came from my lessons with a bit of a chill, so it’ll have to wait.” With that, Qianxue or some other maid left to do so. Zhou Rui’s wife went off without further incident.

It turned out that Zhou Rui’s wife’s son-in-law was Cold Zixing, a friend of Yu Cun, and currently embroiled in a lawsuit over antiques he’d sold. Relying on the family’s influence, she intended to ask Wang Xifeng that evening to resolve the matter. After dusk, Wang Xifeng removed her elaborate hairstyle, visited Lady Wang, and reported, “Today something arrived from the Zhen household; I’ve already accepted it. As for what we’re sending them, we arranged for them to take it back by boat, since it’s almost the New Year.” Lady Wang nodded. Xifeng continued, “It’s the Dowager Countess of Lin’an’s birthday soon, and the gift is ready. Whom shall we send with it?” Lady Wang replied, “Check who’s free—dispatch four maids to handle it. Why ask me about such trivial details?” Xifeng said, “Today Sister Zhen from the other mansion invited me to come tomorrow for a stroll. Is there anything going on tomorrow that would prevent me?” Lady Wang said, “Busy or not, it doesn’t matter. Usually when she invites us and we all go, it’s a bit too formal. Since this time she only invited you, it shows sincere friendship, giving you a chance for some leisure. Don’t turn her down—go.” Xifeng agreed. Li Wan, Tanchun, and the other young ladies made their final courtesies for the night and returned to their rooms, closing the day’s affairs.

Next morning, Xifeng dressed, first reporting to Lady Wang, then saying goodbye to Grandmother Jia. Baoyu, upon hearing, insisted on joining, leaving Xifeng with no choice but to acquiesce. After changing outfits, they rode in a carriage together. On arriving at the Ning Mansion, they saw that Jia Zhen’s wife, You-shi, and Jia Rong’s wife, Qin-shi—a mother-and-daughter-in-law pair—led a large group of junior wives and maids to greet them at the main gate. The moment You-shi spotted Xifeng, she teased her, took Baoyu by the hand, and guided them to the principal hall. Qin-shi served them tea. Xifeng joked, “Why did you invite me here? What gifts do you plan to honor me with? Hurry and show them, I have things to do!” Before You-shi could respond, a few senior maidservants laughed, “Second Mistress, if you hadn’t come, fine—but now that you’re here, we’re not letting you leave so easily.” Midway through these exchanges, Jia Rong entered to pay respects. Baoyu asked, “Where’s my eldest brother? Not at home?” You-shi replied, “He went outside the city to greet Master.” Adding, “Aren’t you bored just sitting here? Why not go have a look around?” Qin-shi, laughing, said, “Perfect timing. Last time, Uncle Bao wanted to see my younger brother. Today he’s in the study—why not go say hello?” Baoyu was eager to do just that. You-shi told the maids to watch him carefully. Xifeng asked, “Why not bring him here for me to see?” You-shi laughed, “Better not—he’s not like our own children, who grew up rough-and-tumble. He’s well-mannered and has never experienced your lively sort. He’d just be frightened.” Xifeng laughed, “I won’t tease him, so what’s the harm if I see him? Or is it that he’ll tease me?” Jia Rong said, “My brother’s timid. He has never seen a big scene. Aunt, you might get upset if he’s too shy.” Xifeng spat jokingly, “Bah, nonsense—whether he’s a little creature or some legendary brat, I must see him. No more babbling, or I’ll give you a good slap.” Jia Rong squinted with a grin. “Why so fierce, Aunt? I’ll bring him right now.” Xifeng smiled along with him.

Shortly, Jia Rong returned with a young man: slightly thinner than Baoyu, with fine eyebrows and bright eyes, a fair face and red lips, slender and graceful, brimming with a romantic flair—perhaps even surpassing Baoyu in looks. Yet he was modest and easily embarrassed, showing a trace of feminine shyness. Bowing politely to greet Xifeng, he answered softly. Delighted, Xifeng playfully nudged Baoyu. “You lose!” She reached out, grabbed the boy’s hand, made him sit beside her, and gently asked his age and schooling. They learned his formal name was Qin Zhong. Some of the maids serving Xifeng noticed she had not prepared a small greeting gift for meeting Qin Zhong. They tiptoed out to find Ping’er, who, well aware of Xifeng’s close ties to Qin-shi, took it upon herself to fetch a length of fine cloth and two little gold charms with “Top Graduate” inscriptions, handing them to the maids to give Qin Zhong. Xifeng still thought it too meager, but Qin-shi and the others offered thanks all the same. After lunch, You-shi, Xifeng, and Qin-shi gathered for a round of bone-domino games, details omitted.

Meanwhile, Baoyu and Qin Zhong found a place to sit and chat at ease. The moment Baoyu first saw Qin Zhong, he felt a strange sense of loss, staring blankly for quite a while. A muddled sentiment arose in his heart: “That there could be such a person in the world! Compared to him, I’m nothing but a mangy dog or a pig in the mud. Why must I have been born in a noble mansion, shackled by so many constraints? If I’d been born in a family of modest scholars or minor officials, I might have gotten to know someone like him more intimately. Even though I have higher status, my robes of silk and brocade merely wrap around a withered stump. My splendid feasts are no different from filling a foul pit. ‘Wealth and honor’—aren’t they truly poisonous illusions?” Qin Zhong likewise, upon seeing Baoyu with his radiant looks, refined manner, plus a gold coronet and embroidered robes, accompanied by lovely maids, realized, “It’s no wonder my sister praises him incessantly. But I, having been born to a humble family, how can I ever enjoy deep companionship with such a figure? It’s all in fate, I suppose.” Both were lost in reflection. Eventually Baoyu asked what texts Qin Zhong studied. Qin Zhong answered candidly. Within just ten exchanges, they felt a growing closeness. Someone then arrived with tea and snacks. Baoyu said, “We’re not drinking wine, so let’s move these refreshments onto that small kang in the back room. We can leave these older folks in peace.” Thus the pair withdrew into the back room. Qin-shi alternated between entertaining Xifeng and occasionally popping in. Seeing them so engrossed, she reminded Baoyu, “Second Uncle, your nephew is still young—if he says something careless, please don’t mind. He’s shy, but also stubborn, not too easygoing.” Baoyu laughed, “Go ahead, I understand.” Qin-shi reminded her brother once more, then returned to Xifeng.

Soon, Xifeng or You-shi sent someone to ask Baoyu if he wanted anything else. He just said no, focusing more on chatting with Qin Zhong about family matters. Qin Zhong explained, “Last year, my tutor resigned. My father is advanced in age, disabled, and burdened with official tasks, so he hasn’t arranged for a new teacher yet. At present, I only go over my old lessons at home. Besides, one really benefits from having a study companion or two, with whom one can discuss and thereby improve.” Baoyu, not waiting for him to finish, exclaimed, “Exactly. Our family has a private school for clan members who lack tutors, so that relatives and younger kin can all study. Since last year my teacher returned home, that school remains idle. Father wants me to go there to review old texts, pending a new instructor next year. But Grandmother thinks, first, too many boys in one place might encourage trouble, and second, because I fell ill recently, she delayed. Judging from your father’s worries, why not have him propose that you join our school? That way I’ll be there too, so we can both benefit. Wouldn’t that be great?” Qin Zhong laughed, “Father indeed just mentioned your family’s charitable school. He wanted to ask your father to sponsor me, but you’ve had so many things going on that we felt it was trivial and didn’t like to bother you. If you truly find me worthy of studying by your side, then please help settle it as soon as possible. That way we won’t waste time, and we can be in each other’s company, ease our parents’ concerns, and share the joy of friendship. Isn’t that splendid?” Baoyu said, “Don’t worry! Today we’ll let your brother-in-law and sister know, then you go home and inform your father. I’ll talk to my grandmother. Nothing will keep it from happening at once.”

The two concluded that plan. By now, dusk had fallen. They emerged to watch the older folks finish a round of gambling. When the scores were tallied, it happened that Qin-shi and You-shi had lost the cost of drinks, so they arranged to host another gathering soon. Everyone then had dinner. Because it was now fully dark, You-shi said, “Someone must escort Qin Zhong home.” The maids relayed the instruction, but after a while reported back that Jiao Da had been assigned—who, unfortunately, was already drunk and cursing. Both You-shi and Qin-shi protested, “Why send him? Weren’t there other men to do it? This just courts trouble!” Xifeng remarked, “People say you’re too soft, tolerating your staff to this extent. This is no good.” You-shi sighed, “Don’t you realize the problem with Jiao Da? Even the master himself doesn’t discipline him, nor does my husband’s nephew. He used to follow the old master into war on three or four campaigns, saving his life from among piles of the dead. There was once no food, and he stole provisions for the master; once we had no water for two days, and Jiao Da found half a bowl which he offered wholly to the master, drinking none himself. With such meritorious service, under our elders, everyone treated him differently. Now, no one wants to punish him. He’s grown old and disregards propriety, doing nothing but guzzling wine. After he’s drunk, there’s no one he won’t insult. I’ve advised the stewards that from now on, we shouldn’t even give him errands. Pretend he doesn’t exist. So of course they still put him on tasks, and here we are!” Xifeng said, “I understand. Ultimately you all lack resolve. Why not send him far away to a farm estate? That’d solve it.” Then she asked, “Is our carriage ready?” The women replied, “It’s waiting.”

Xifeng rose, preparing to depart, Baoyu in hand. You-shi and the rest escorted them to the main hall, where lanterns blazed brilliantly, and rows of young porters stood on the terrace. Jiao Da, emboldened by drink, noticed that Jia Zhen was absent, so he vented at top volume, first cursing the chief steward Lai Er: “Unfair, bullying the weak, giving cushy tasks to others while sending me off on this late-night fool’s errand. Heartless scoundrels, parading as managers! Don’t forget that in the old days, if Jiao Da so much as raised a leg, it was higher than your head. Two decades ago, who dared cross Jiao Da’s eyes? Let alone you pack of mongrel whelps!” He ranted more wildly still. Jia Rong, about to drive out with Xifeng’s carriage, tried shouting him down. Unable to contain himself, Jia Rong cursed back a little, then hollered, “Tie him up! Let’s see if he’s still so eager to die once he sobers tomorrow!” But Jiao Da, ignoring Jia Rong, roared on, lunging at him. “Rong boy, don’t pull rank in front of Jiao Da! Not you, not your father, not your grandfather can posture around me! Without Jiao Da, you’d never hold official posts to enjoy wealth and privilege! Your ancestors risked death after death to secure this family fortune, yet you show me no gratitude, playing the master. I’d let it go if you said nothing else, but keep talking, and we’ll see ‘the red blade go in, the white blade come out’!” From the carriage, Xifeng called to Jia Rong, “Why not hurry up and get rid of that lawless fellow? Keeping him here is harmful. If relatives heard such a scene, wouldn’t they laugh that a house like ours can’t maintain order?” Jia Rong answered, “Yes, indeed.”

Seeing his uproar, more servants rushed in, pinned Jiao Da down, and dragged him to the stable yard. He, all the more enraged, began naming even Jia Zhen, hollering about how he would go weep at the ancestral hall for the old master, lamenting never expecting such worthless descendants: “Stealing dogs, teasing chickens, crawling up ashes if they want, raising the younger uncle if they choose—like I’m ignorant of it all? The lot of you keep your arms broken inside your sleeves!” The junior attendants, realizing the magnitude of his accusations, were petrified, quickly trussing him up and cramming mud and horse dung into his mouth. From a distance, Xifeng and Jia Rong heard but pretended not to, ignoring him entirely.

Baoyu, also hearing some of this from inside the carriage, asked Xifeng, “Sister, you heard him say ‘crawling up ashes’—what does that mean?” Xifeng swiftly snapped, “Stop spouting nonsense! He’s a drunken fool. You’re hardly the kind of boy to be repeating what you overhear. Dare mention it again, and I’ll tell Aunt Wang to thrash you!” Terrified, Baoyu pleaded, “Good sister, I promise never to mention it.” Xifeng coaxed him, “All right then. My dear brother, that’s how it must be. Once we return, we’ll report to Grandmother. Then we can send word to the family school about enrolling Qin Zhong soon.” With that, they made for the Rong Mansion. Should one wish to see what comes next, we must await the following chapter.
CHAPTER 8

Jia Baoyu, by Strange Fate, Recognizes the Golden Locket;
Xue Baochai, by Fortuitous Coincidence, Discerns the Magic Jade

The story goes that after Baoyu and Wang Xifeng returned home, they greeted the household. Baoyu then informed Grandmother Jia of his plan to invite Qin Zhong to study at the family school, saying he himself needed a companion, so he could devote himself more seriously. He highly praised Qin Zhong’s demeanor and behavior, calling him utterly endearing and lovable. Xifeng stood by, echoing his words: “We’ll have Qin Zhong come soon to formally meet Grandmother.” Grandmother Jia was delighted. Seizing the opportunity, Xifeng invited Grandmother Jia to come watch a play at the Ning Mansion. Although advanced in years, Grandmother Jia was quite enthusiastic. A few days later, when Madam You from the Ning side invited them again, she brought along Lady Wang, Lin Daiyu, Baoyu, and others. By midday, Grandmother Jia returned home to rest. Lady Wang, preferring peace and quiet, departed once she saw Grandmother Jia had left. Xifeng, seated in the seat of honor, continued the merriment until evening before dispersing.

Meanwhile, Baoyu escorted Grandmother Jia back. After the grandmother lay down for her midday nap, Baoyu found himself wanting to return to the play but also feared that might inconvenience Qin Shi and the others. Remembering that Baochai had been convalescing at home and he had yet to visit her, he decided to stop by. However, if he went through the back corner door of the main quarters, he might run into other entanglements or, worse yet, encounter her father, which would be especially awkward. So he made up his mind to take a more roundabout route. Just then, a group of nurses and maids helped him change clothes—but when he did not change, he simply went out the second gate. The older nurses and maids had no choice but to follow along, assuming he was heading to watch the play at the other mansion. Who would have guessed that once reaching the passage near the hall, he veered northeast behind the main hall to proceed elsewhere?

Just then, he ran into two household “retainers” or personal hangers-on—Zhan Guang and Shan Puren. As soon as they saw Baoyu, they hurried up to him, one grabbing him around the waist, the other grasping his hand, exclaiming, “Dear young master, we had such a good omen in our dreams—how fortunate to meet you!” They chattered effusively for a while before letting go. One of the older maids called after them, “You two must be going to see the Master, aren’t you?” The men nodded, “Yes.” They added with a laugh, “But the Master is napping in the Mengpo Study; it’s no problem.” They went on their way, Baoyu likewise smiling as he continued around the corner, heading north toward Pear Fragrance Court.

By chance, the chief storehouse overseer, Wu Xindeng, and the grain depot supervisor, Dai Liang, along with several other heads of various departments—a total of seven people—were coming out of the accounts office. Seeing Baoyu, they hurriedly stood with their hands at their sides. Only one middleman, named Qian Hua, who had not seen Baoyu in days, advanced to salute him wholeheartedly. Baoyu, smiling, extended his hand for the man to rise. The rest laughed, “We recently glimpsed some square decorative calligraphy you made—your brushwork has grown truly fine. We’re all waiting for a chance to request a bit more of your writing.” Baoyu laughed, “Where did you see that?” They answered, “It’s everywhere around, widely praised. Even we lesser folks are looking around for it!” Baoyu said, “It’s nothing special. If you want some, mention it to my young attendants, that’s all.” Talking as he walked on, the men stood aside until he passed, then each went about his business.

Enough of that. Baoyu then arrived at Pear Fragrance Court. First, he went into Aunt Xue’s quarters and saw her arranging needlework items for the maids. Baoyu swiftly paid his respects. Aunt Xue embraced him with a laugh, saying, “It’s such a cold day, and yet here you are! Come up on the kang and sit.” She instructed someone to bring hot tea. Baoyu asked, “Is my elder brother not at home?” Aunt Xue sighed, “He’s a horse without a bridle, out seeking amusement every day. He can’t stand to stay in the house.” Baoyu asked, “Has Sister recovered?” Aunt Xue replied, “Indeed so, and I appreciate your thoughtfulness in sending word the other day. She’s in the inner room—why not go see her? It’s warmer there than here. You can sit with her. I’ll tidy a bit and come in to talk.”

Baoyu promptly headed to the inner room. At the door hung a red silk curtain, slightly worn. Stepping inside, he saw Baochai on the kang, sewing. Her hair was styled plainly in a glossy, dark bun. She wore a honey-colored cotton jacket, a two-tone pink-and-gold vest, and a pale yellow silk skirt, all slightly used, neither new nor showy. Rather than looking extravagant, she appeared subdued and tasteful—reserved in speech, seemingly slow to speak, which others deemed “feigning foolishness;” willing to live simply, which she called “preserving simplicity.” Glancing up to see Baoyu enter, Baochai immediately rose with a smile, saying, “I’m almost fully better. Thank you for remembering me.” She had him sit on the edge of the kang and called to Ying’er, “Bring tea.” Then she asked after Grandmother, Lady Wang, and the other girls. At the same time, she studied Baoyu’s attire: a gold filigree headdress set with gems, a purple-gold forehead band with two dragons chasing pearls, a short-sleeved fur coat of autumn-fragrance color embroidered with curling dragons on white fox trim, a five-color palace sash with tassels at his waist, and around his neck a longevity locket and amulets plus that piece of jade he’d carried since birth. Baochai smiled, remarking, “They always talk about that jade of yours, but I’ve never carefully examined it. Let me see it today.” Baoyu obliged, leaning closer to pass it over. Baochai weighed it in her hand, noticing it was about the size of a sparrow’s egg, gleaming like rosy clouds, smooth as cream, threaded with multicolored lines.

Reader, be aware: this is that piece of stubborn stone from the Green Ridge Peak beneath Great Desolation Mountain. In later times, a satirical verse described it thus:

“Though Nüwa’s precious stone once mended heaven,
Now it wanders, weaving illusions in a vast realm.
Its true face lost, it conjures a mortal husk,
Full of worldly stench.
When luck fails, gold lacks its luster,
And fate turns, dimming the jade’s glow.
White bones rise like mountains, names forgotten,
Leaving lords and ladies in the dust.”
That stone had recorded its own transformations and the characters inscribed by the mendicant monk, later depicted in illustration. Its real shape was small from the start, found in the mouth of a newborn. If we attempted an exact rendering with minute script, readers would strain their eyes too much. For convenience, it’s shown somewhat enlarged in any painting. With that note, no one need question how such a large object could be clenched in an infant’s mouth.

After Baochai examined it, she flipped it to see the front side again, murmuring softly: “Mo shi mo wang, xian shou heng chang” (“Never forget, eternal life and everlasting fortune”). She recited it twice, then looked at Ying’er with a grin, saying, “Why are you still standing there gaping instead of pouring tea?” Ying’er giggled, “I heard those lines, and they happen to pair so well with the inscription on our young lady’s own necklace.” Baoyu overheard and blurted, “What, Sister, you also have script on your necklace? Let me examine it.” Baochai quickly said, “Don’t listen to her nonsense—no words at all.” But Baoyu pleaded, “Good Sister, you examined mine, so let me see yours too!” Baochai, pressed, said, “It’s just someone’s auspicious phrase, engraved for good luck, that’s all. Otherwise, that heavy thing is no fun to wear.” She then unbuttoned her front closure, took out a gold-lustered necklace of pearls and ornaments, radiant with jewels. Baoyu held the locket, seeing there were indeed four words on one side and four on the other, totaling eight characters forming two lines of cryptic verse.

Reading them, Baoyu recited each line twice, then repeated his own lines from his jade, finally saying with a laugh, “Sister, these eight characters on yours align perfectly with mine.” Ying’er, chuckling, said, “Yes, it was a scabby-headed monk who gave it, insisting it be engraved in gold.” Baochai cut her off, frowning, “Go pour tea!” Then she asked Baoyu where he was coming from.

At that moment, Baoyu, sitting close by her, noticed a faint but distinct fragrance, unfamiliar to him, so he asked, “Sister, what incense are you burning? I’ve never smelled such a scent.” Baochai replied, “I can’t stand incense on clothes. Why ruin perfectly good garments?” Baoyu said, “So if you’re not burning anything, what is this fragrance?” Baochai thought a bit and said, “Oh, it must be from when I took a Cold Fragrance Pill earlier this morning.” Baoyu asked with delight, “Is that what you call it? It smells wonderful. Dearest Sister, might I sample one?” Baochai laughed, “At it again? Since when do you treat medicine like a snack?”

Before she could finish, someone outside announced, “Miss Lin has arrived.” Even as they spoke, Daiyu entered with a slight sway, glimpsing Baoyu, and teased, “Well, I didn’t time this well.” Baoyu and Baochai both stood and welcomed her in. Baochai asked with a smile, “Why do you say that?” Daiyu replied, “If I had known he was here, I wouldn’t have come.” Baochai said, “What’s that supposed to mean?” Daiyu explained, “It’s nothing complicated. If we always arrive together, or not come at all, how dull that would be. So I come one time, he another, so it’s neither too lonely nor too crowded. Is that so hard to grasp?” Baoyu, noticing she wore a short overgown of bright red feathered satin, asked, “Is it snowing outside?” One of the older women responded, “It’s been falling for half the day.” Baoyu said, “Bring me my cape.” Daiyu smirked, “Sure enough, I show up and he’s anxious to leave.” Baoyu said, “I never said I was leaving—just have it on hand.” His nurse, Li mama, remarked, “Young sir, it is snowing. Might you consider just staying with these girls? Aunt Xue is setting tea. I’ll send word for someone to fetch your cape here, and the rest can disperse.” Baoyu agreed. Li mama then stepped outside and ordered some footmen, “All of you disperse. No need to wait around.”

Inside, Aunt Xue set out a few delicate tea snacks, inviting them to drink tea and enjoy some sweets. Baoyu recalled how, at the Ning Mansion earlier, he had enjoyed the goose’s webbing, praising the tender texture of Madame Zhen’s cooking. Aunt Xue quickly brought out some marinated goose webs she herself had prepared. Baoyu observed with a smile, “This is best with wine!” Aunt Xue directed a maid to fetch a high-quality vintage. Li mama tried to intervene, saying, “Madam, he shouldn’t be allowed to drink.” Baoyu pleaded, “I’ll only have one cup, dear nurse.” Li mama said, “Nonsense. In front of Grandmother or Lady Wang, you could drink a vat. But that day I overlooked someone giving you a sip, and I got scolded for two days. Aunt Xue might not fully realize your temperament. Once you’ve had wine, you get rowdy, right? Let’s not risk it.” Aunt Xue laughed, “Old dear, rest easy. I won’t let him overindulge. If Grandmother asks, I’ll take the blame.” Then she coaxed the old nurse herself, “Have a drink of hot wine to ward off the chill.” Li mama, assured, left to share a cup with the servants. Baoyu insisted on having his wine cool, but Aunt Xue objected, “Cold wine congeals in your organs, not good for you.” Baochai chimed in, “Indeed, wine is by nature hot. If you drink it warm, it disperses outward. If you drink it cold, your body must use its warmth to heat it, which is harmful. You should avoid that from now on.” Baoyu, swayed by her reasoning, forwent the chilled wine, letting them heat it first. Meanwhile, Daiyu nibbled on melon seeds, silently smiling. At that moment, Daiyu’s maid Snowgoose entered with a tiny handwarmer for her, prompting Daiyu to exclaim, “Who told you to bring that? Did they imagine I’d freeze to death in here?” Snowgoose answered, “Purple Cuckoo was worried you might catch cold, so she told me to fetch it.” Daiyu, hugging the little heater to her, teased, “And you obey her commands? All my own words go in one ear and out the other, yet at her slightest remark, you jump as if it were an imperial edict!” Baoyu overheard, realizing she was taking a jab at him, but had no ready reply, so he just grinned foolishly. Baochai, who understood Daiyu’s usual ways, let it pass. Aunt Xue intervened with a smile, “My dear, you’re frail and can’t handle the cold. They care about you. Isn’t that a good thing?” Daiyu responded, “Aunt, you don’t know the half of it—thank goodness we’re at your house. Otherwise, it’d look as if the hosts had no warm stoves, forcing me to send for my own. One might think me petty, or the maids over-anxious. Or perhaps people would suspect me of flightiness.” Aunt Xue said, “You think too much. I simply do not have such thoughts.” Baoyu, meanwhile, had already drunk three cups. Li mama returned, trying to hold him back. Baoyu was at the peak of enjoyment, exchanging banter with his cousins, and refused to quit. He tried appealing to her, “Let me have two more cups.” She warned him, “Remember that the Master is home today. He may well quiz you on your books.” Hearing that, Baoyu grew sullen, quietly setting down the wine. Daiyu stepped in, saying, “No need to spoil the mood. If your father calls for you, we’ll say Aunt Xue kept you. That nurse is forever nagging.” She then nudged him. “Don’t fret—just keep enjoying yourself.” Li mama, quite aware of Daiyu’s nature, retorted, “Miss Lin, you ought to persuade him otherwise, not encourage him. After all, if the Old Madam or Lady Wang indulge him with wine, that’s different. But here in Aunt Xue’s place, it’s still just a single sip extra. Does that matter so much that you must run me down for being cautious?” Daiyu responded with a chilly laugh, “Why should I meddle in his business? I have no cause to talk him out of it. You’re overly anxious. If the Old Madam lets him drink some, how can it harm that it’s a bit more at Aunt Xue’s? Unless you consider this an outsider’s household, so it’s not proper for him to drink more here.” Li mama, half frustrated and half amused, exclaimed, “You’re truly too sharp in tongue, Miss Lin!” Baochai could not help smiling. She gave Daiyu a playful pinch on the cheek, saying, “You obstinate girl. One remark from your mouth can sting both ways.” Aunt Xue laughed too, reassuring Baoyu, “No need to feel uneasy. My dear, I’m sorry if I have nothing better to serve you. But do not let a small fuss weigh on your heart. Drink as you please—I won’t let you have too much. Why not stay for dinner? Even if you overindulge, you can rest with me. More warm wine, please. I’ll keep him company for a pair of cups, then we’ll dine.” Thus Baoyu’s spirits revived. Li mama informed a few maids, “Stay near, or I’ll go home to switch clothes and come back.” Quietly, she whispered to Aunt Xue, “Please keep track that he doesn’t overdrink.” She left. The older maids recognized no major rules hindered them, so they drifted off, leaving only a pair of junior maids who were pleased to cater to Baoyu. Fortunately, Aunt Xue carefully monitored him, letting him have only a few more cups before removing the wine. She then served a pickled-bamboo-and-chicken-skin soup, which Baoyu gulped down in several bowls, plus half a bowl of green polished-rice porridge. Then, once both Xue and Lin had eaten, she gave them strong tea. At that point she felt reassured. Daiyu’s maid Snowgoose and a few others, having had their meal, returned to wait on them. Daiyu inquired, “Shall we leave now?” Baoyu, heavy-lidded, said, “If you’re leaving, I’ll come too.” Daiyu nodded, “We’ve spent the day here, so it’s time to go.” Both rose to say goodbye. A maid brought forth a cap to keep out the snow, which Baoyu tried to place on his head. But as she settled it, pressing it too firmly, Baoyu snapped, “All right, all right—enough! Are you trying to smother me? Let me do it myself.” Daiyu, perched on the edge of the kang, teased, “Come here, let me fix it for you.” Baoyu approached, and Daiyu carefully set the brim above his forehead band so that the walnut-sized tassel could stand upright, swaying in front. Finished, she inspected him for a moment. “Done. Now put on your cape.” Baoyu complied, taking the cape from her and draping it on. Aunt Xue advised, “Your nurse still isn’t back. Why not wait a moment?” Baoyu said, “What would we wait for her? We have plenty of maids. That suffices.” But Aunt Xue, uneasy, assigned two older women to escort them back.

Thus the pair took their leave, heading straight to Grandmother Jia’s quarters. Hearing they had come from Aunt Xue’s, Grandmother Jia was delighted. Seeing Baoyu had drunk wine, she ordered him straight to his room to rest, warning that he mustn’t wander tonight. She also told the servants to keep a close eye on him. Then she recalled that someone was missing from Baoyu’s group, so she asked, “Where is Nurse Li?” None dared say she had slipped home; they only said, “She popped in earlier, then stepped out again, presumably on an errand.” Baoyu overheard and grumbled, “She’s more exalted than even Grandmother—why ask about her? Without her, I might even live a day or two longer!” Muttering thus, he went to his own apartment. There, brushes and ink lay out on the desk. Seeing him, Qingwen stepped forward and laughed, “So be it. You had me grind a quantity of ink this morning. You wrote three characters, tossed aside your brush, and disappeared, leaving me waiting all day. Now you must finish, or you’ve wasted my effort.” Baoyu, slightly drunk, asked her, “Which three characters? Where are they?” Qingwen answered, “You’re truly tipsy. You were heading to the other mansion, telling me it was for the sign above your door. I feared someone else might paste it poorly, so I personally climbed high to affix it, half-freezing my hands. Now you ask?” Baoyu smiled, “I forgot. Your hands must be cold—let me warm them.” So he reached for Qingwen’s hands, preparing to do so. Then they looked at the newly hung sign with the three characters.

Moments later, Daiyu appeared. Baoyu teased, “Dear Sister, which letter do you think is best out of these three?” Daiyu looked up, seeing “Jangyun Xuan” (Rouge-Cloud Studio) in large script. She smiled, “They’re all equally fine. You should do one for me as well someday.” Baoyu laughed, “There you go, teasing me again.” He asked, “Where is Sister Hua?” Qingwen gestured toward the inner kang. Baoyu turned to see that Hua, known as Huar, or actually “Hua” might be a placeholder for Xi Ren. Let’s correct it: The text says “Where is Sister Xiren?” She was half lying on the couch, apparently asleep. Baoyu smiled, “So early to bed, is she?” Then he asked Qingwen, “This morning at breakfast on the other side, they had some tofu-skin dumplings. I thought you liked them and told Cousin Zhen’s wife I’d take some home for supper. Did they arrive?” Qingwen answered, “Yes, I saw them. Right after lunch, I set them aside. Then Nurse Li came in, saying, ‘Baoyu probably won’t eat them. Let me take them home for my grandchild.’ So off they went.” Baoyu was indignant. As Chixue (another maid) brought him tea, he abruptly said, “This is not the tea from earlier. I recall specifically brewing a cup of Maple Dew tea, which only gains flavor by the third or fourth infusion. Where is it?” Chixue answered, “I saved it, but then Nurse Li arrived and drank it. She claimed you might not want it.” With that, Baoyu flung his teacup to the floor, smashing it, shards flying near Chixue’s skirt. He leapt up, fuming, “She calls herself my ‘Nanny’? You all pamper her as if she were an empress. She merely nursed me a short time in infancy. Now she struts around like a tyrant—someone throw her out for good!” He threatened to march off and tell Grandmother right away.

Yet Xi Ren had not really been asleep, just feigning it, waiting to see how Baoyu would behave. Hearing the crashing of china, she hurried up to calm him. A messenger from Grandmother Jia’s place arrived to inquire, “What’s happened?” Xi Ren quickly answered, “He dropped the teacup because the floor was slippery. Nothing more.” She coaxed Baoyu, “If you’re set on dismissing her, so be it. We’re all ready to go if you prefer. Then you can find better ones to serve you.” Baoyu, hearing this, finally said no more. The girls guided him to the heated kang, stripped off his outer garments. He mumbled something but seemed more pliant. They laid him down to rest. Xi Ren then removed the Magic Jade from his neck, wrapped it in a cloth, and tucked it under the bedding, lest it chill his skin the next morning. Baoyu, hardly finishing his words, fell sound asleep. By then, Li mama and the others had come back. Learning he was drunk and asleep, they dared not disturb him further, quietly dispersing.

The following morning, as Baoyu awakened, word arrived: “Young Master Rong from the other mansion has come with Qin Zhong to pay respects.” Baoyu hurried out, welcomed Qin Zhong, then accompanied him to pay respects to Grandmother Jia. Seeing Qin Zhong’s refined appearance and gentle manner, Grandmother Jia, deducing that such a companion was indeed suited to Baoyu, was most pleased. She kept them for tea and a meal, and then had Qin Zhong meet Lady Wang and the others. Everyone, fond of Qin Shi, took warmly to her brother. They gave him various small welcoming gifts. Grandmother Jia further bestowed a pouch plus a little gold figure of the Scholar Star, invoking “May the stars favor your studies.” She bade him, “Your home is far. Should weather or distance prove inconvenient, you can reside here with your Uncle Bao. Don’t follow the rowdy ones.” Qin Zhong assented to everything and went home to inform his father.

His father, Qin Bangye, currently held a position as a Langzhong in the Construction Office, nearing seventy, with no wife (she had died) and no direct heirs but for the daughter he’d adopted at a charity home along with a son. That son died, leaving only the adopted daughter, nicknamed Ke’er but formally called Jianmei. She grew to be graceful and had eventually married into the Jia clan. At age fifty-three, he fathered Qin Zhong, who was now twelve. Last year, the tutor had departed south, leaving Qin Zhong idle at home. They had intended to discuss letting him join the Jia family’s charitable school, pending the old teacher, Jia Dairu. Learning from Baoyu that it was indeed feasible, and that such an arrangement would help Qin Zhong’s development and potential future success, Qin Bangye was delighted—except his funds were limited, and the Jia household’s eyes tended to see only wealth. Still, for his son’s prospects, he managed to scrape together a ceremonious gift of twenty-four taels in an elegant package, taking Qin Zhong to greet Jia Dairu. After waiting for Baoyu to pick a propitious day, the two of them enrolled. From that day onward, the clan school would stir up fresh commotion.

How events unfold, we shall see in the next chapter.
CHAPTER 9

Disciplining an Unruly Boy: Li Gui Receives a Stern Reprimand;
Berating a Mischievous Child: Mingyan Causes Trouble in the Schoolroom

When Qin Bangye and his son awaited official word from the Jia family regarding enrolling at the clan’s school, Baoyu, eager to spend time with Qin Zhong, chose a date two days later for their enrollment. He sent someone with the message. On the appointed morning, Baoyu rose. Xiren had already packed his books, pens, and materials, sitting on the bedside in low spirits. Seeing Baoyu get up, she served him as he washed and dressed. Baoyu noticed her gloom and asked, “Kind sister, what’s making you unhappy? Are you worried the house will feel lonely once I start attending class?”

Xiren smiled faintly. “Why would I worry about that? Studying is a fine thing—otherwise you’d waste your whole life with nothing to show. But remember one point: when studying, keep your mind on it. When away from lessons, think of home. Don’t get carried away fooling around with them. If you cross paths with the Master, trouble will follow. Even if you’re keen to improve, be moderate in how much you tackle at once; not too many texts, or you’ll bite off more than you can chew, and you must protect your health. That’s what’s on my mind. Please keep it in your thoughts.”

With each sentence, Baoyu nodded in agreement. Xiren continued, “I’ve wrapped your large fur clothes and sent them along with the young men. The schoolhouse is cold, so be sure to change as needed—there’s no one there to look after you. As for foot-stoves and hand-warmers, I’ve handed those over as well. You’ll have to insist they light them for you. Those idle layabouts would happily let you freeze if you didn’t speak up.”

Baoyu answered, “Don’t worry. I can manage. As for you all, don’t mope in this room—go spend time with Cousin Lin now and then.” So saying, he finished dressing. Xiren pressed him to go see Grandmother Jia, then Jia Zheng, and Lady Wang. Baoyu gave a few final instructions to Qingwen and Sheyue before setting off. He visited Grandmother Jia first, receiving a few words of advice. Then he reported to Lady Wang. Finally, he headed to the study to greet Jia Zheng.

That day, Jia Zheng was in the study, idly chatting with some literary guests. When Baoyu came to pay respects, announcing he was off to school, Jia Zheng gave a cold laugh: “The next time you speak of ‘going to school,’ I’ll die of shame. Were I to advise you, I’d say you’re better off idling. Don’t come sullying my floor or polluting my doorway!” The companions in the room rose with polite laughter, intervening: “Master needn’t be so stern. On this day the young master sets out, and in two or three years he’ll doubtless achieve something—no longer a mere child.” Checking the hour, they urged, “It’s nearly noon. The young master should go quickly.” At that, two older scholars helped usher Baoyu out. Jia Zheng called, “Who’s accompanying Baoyu?” Immediately, from outside came the voices of three or four stout men stepping in, bowing. Jia Zheng recognized Li Gui, the son of Baoyu’s wet nurse, among them. He addressed Li Gui: “You’re the ones who escort him daily, yet has he learned anything? All he’s acquired is sly talk and fine mischief. Once I have time, I’ll tear a strip off you, and that worthless boy as well!” Terrified, Li Gui dropped to his knees, doffing his cap and knocking his head on the ground, repeating, “Yes, sir!” hurriedly adding, “He’s already up to the third volume of the Book of Songs—something about ‘roaming deer, lotus leaves, duckweed’… I wouldn’t dare lie.” Everyone in the study roared with laughter, and even Jia Zheng couldn’t keep from smiling. “Even if he read thirty volumes of the Book of Songs, it would still be ‘covering one’s ears while stealing a bell,’ fooling us. Go tell the venerable instructor that I said he needn’t bother with The Book of Songs or old essays. Let him make Baoyu focus on the Four Books, reciting them thoroughly. That’s what matters most.” Li Gui assented and, seeing no further orders, got up and withdrew.

Baoyu, left standing alone in the courtyard, kept silent, awaiting Li Gui and the others so they could set off together. As they came out, tidying their clothes, Li Gui muttered, “Young master, you heard that? He threatened to skin us. Other servants earn favor serving their masters; we only get beaten and scolded. Do have some pity on us!” Baoyu replied with a laugh, “Good brother, don’t be upset. I’ll treat you soon.” Li Gui said, “Young master, who dares expect a treat? We only hope to hear a kind word or two from you, that’s all.”

With that, they headed toward Grandmother Jia’s quarters, where Qin Zhong was already waiting, conversing with her. Baoyu and Qin Zhong exchanged greetings, then bid farewell to Grandmother Jia. Baoyu suddenly recalled he had not taken leave of Lin Daiyu. He darted to her room, where Daiyu happened to be by the window, dressing her hair. Hearing he was off to school, she laughed, “Excellent! So now you’ll ‘pluck the laurel from the moon palace.’ I won’t be accompanying you there!” Baoyu teased, “Sweet cousin, let’s talk this evening. Don’t forget we planned to finish mixing that rouge. Let me see you tonight after class.” They bantered for a while before Baoyu managed to pull away. Daiyu called after him, “Why not also say goodbye to your Precious Sister?” Baoyu gave a short laugh and said nothing, leading Qin Zhong to school.

This clan school was not far away, originally established by the founder of the lineage, for younger kinsmen who couldn’t afford tutors. The family’s officials contributed to its expenses, employing a venerable teacher. Thus, with Baoyu and Qin Zhong enrolling, they made the rounds of courtesy calls and settled in to study. From then on, they commuted to class together each day, their closeness growing steadily. Grandmother Jia became fond of Qin Zhong, sometimes keeping him overnight for three or five days at a stretch, treating him like a beloved great-grandson. Seeing that his home finances were limited, she also discreetly gifted him clothes and other supplies. Within a mere month or so, Qin Zhong was well at home in the Rong Mansion. Baoyu, ever restless, indulged in spontaneity rather than methodical order. In private, Baoyu said to Qin Zhong, “We’re the same age and classmates now. From this point, let’s set aside uncle and nephew titles. We should be friends and brothers.” Qin Zhong, initially too respectful to agree, relented under Baoyu’s insistence. Baoyu addressed him simply as “brother” and called him by his courtesy name, “Jingqing.” Qin Zhong acquiesced, albeit somewhat nervously.

Yet this school, though primarily filled with clan members and relatives, conformed to the old saying: “A dragon has nine sons, each different.” With so many students, it was inevitable that some were unruly or of dubious character. The arrival of Baoyu and Qin Zhong—both exceptionally comely, with Qin Zhong especially shy and blushing, reminiscent almost of a young lady, while Baoyu was naturally tender-spoken, accustomed to humility and courtesy—stirred talk among the other youths. Their evident bond aroused gossip, fueling rumors around the school.

Meanwhile, since Xue Pan had been staying with Lady Wang, he discovered the family’s school brimming with promising youths, which piqued his inclination toward “Longyang” pursuits. He pretended to enroll, though he rarely attended, bribing the elderly instructor Jia Dairu with small gifts while ignoring any serious study. His true motive was forging flings with certain younger boys. A handful of impressionable students, lured by Xue Pan’s money, indulged him. Among them, two particularly attractive youths—nobody knew exactly which branch they hailed from—had been privately nicknamed “Fragrant Pity” and “Jade Affection.” Many in the school admired them but feared Xue Pan’s domineering ways. Thus, no one else dared approach the pair. However, after Baoyu and Qin Zhong arrived, they, too, couldn’t help noticing these two, yet they hesitated. “Fragrant” and “Jade,” in turn, felt drawn to Qin and Bao but remained uncertain. Secret glances and wordless signals ensued. Some sly rogues in the school picked up on these subtleties, smirking, or coughing suggestively whenever they noticed these covert exchanges. This had gone on for some time.

It happened that one day, Instructor Dairu had urgent business at home, leaving behind a single couplet assignment for the students to complete by the next day, then put the entire school in the hands of his eldest grandson, Jia Rui, for supervision. Xue Pan seldom showed up, so that day Qin Zhong, seeking a moment alone with “Fragrant,” used an excuse to slip out back, where they whispered together. Qin Zhong began, “Does your family restrict your friendships?” Before he could finish, a loud cough startled them from behind. Alarmed, they turned to see a certain Jin Rong, who ironically was both sly and meddlesome. “Fragrant,” somewhat impatient by nature, felt both embarrassed and annoyed. “Why are you coughing right here? Can’t we talk privately?” Jin Rong smirked, “You’re free to talk, and I’m free to cough. Unless you’re doing something sneaky. If not, then why slink around? If I keep quiet, what’s in it for me? Let me, say, get first claim, and we won’t speak further. Otherwise, we can stir things up.” Qin and Fragrant, faces red with anger, demanded, “What do you claim you’ve ‘caught’ us at?” Jin Rong teased, “No point denying it. I saw everything.” Tapping the ground, he laughed about “fresh pancakes,” urging them to buy. The more flustered they got, the more he gloated. They hurried back inside to find Jia Rui, complaining that Jin Rong was insulting them for no cause.

But Jia Rui, a man of questionable character, often exploited his role to extort favors from the students. He had also aided Xue Pan in wrongdoing, hoping for bribes. Lately, however, Xue Pan had found new companions, discarding the old ones, including Jin Rong. Nor did Jia Rui get any fresh rewards. That left him resentful toward Qin Zhong and “Fragrant,” believing they should have persuaded Xue Pan otherwise. So when Qin and Fragrant reported Jin Rong’s bullying, Jia Rui feigned impartiality but scolded Fragrant as meddling. Feeling humiliated, Fragrant had no choice but to leave, with Qin Zhong also retreating in embarrassment.

Exhilarated, Jin Rong swaggered around, bragging, spouting vile gossip about them. “Jade Affection,” overhearing, took offense, and from opposite seats they began a shouting match. Jin Rong persisted in proclaiming that mere moments ago, he had supposedly caught Qin and Fragrant in the back courtyard “kissing and pawing,” sealing a union. Preening in his new advantage, he had no idea who else might be eavesdropping. Unexpectedly, he provoked another person. Who was it? That would be Jia Qiang of the Ning Mansion—a direct descendant by official lineage, orphaned young, reared by Jia Zhen. Sixteen years old, even more handsome than Jia Rong, he led a worldly life, allegedly roving around with Jia Zhen’s permission. Yet within the Ning Mansion, rumors circulated. Possibly to avoid scandal, Jia Zhen, hearing vague complaints, arranged separate quarters for Jia Qiang, letting him set up his own household. Nominally enrolled in this clan school, he hardly studied, mostly indulging in cockfights and outings. With Jia Zhen’s indulgence and Jia Rong’s help, no one dared cross him. Now, seeing Qin Zhong humiliated, Jia Qiang felt outraged on his behalf. Mulling over how to respond, he thought, “But Jin Rong and Jia Rui are Xue Pan’s cronies. I’m also on good terms with Xue Pan. If I intervene, they might report me to Xue Pan, leading to strife. If I do nothing, I’ll watch them spin vile rumors. Better to handle this cunningly, so it all ends quietly, without harming friendships.” Thus resolved, he pretended to head out, beckoning Baoyu’s page Mingyan, discreetly stoking his temper by insinuating that Jin Rong had slandered Baoyu, encouraging Mingyan to “take action.”

Mingyan, young and hot-blooded, readily swallowed this provocation. Arriving in the classroom, he accosted Jin Rong, refusing even to call him “Young Master Jin.” Instead, “Hey you, Jin, who do you think you are?” Jia Qiang stamped his boot as if absentmindedly, glanced at the sky, and declared the hour was right. He told Jia Rui he had some urgent errand and left. Jia Rui dared not stop him, so he let him go.

Mingyan advanced on Jin Rong, seizing him by the lapel: “Our butts have nothing to do with you. It’s not as if your father’s in question. You want a fight? Step outside!” The entire room was thrown into confusion. Jia Rui bellowed, “Mingyan, how dare you act out?” Jin Rong grew furious, “This is insubordination! I’ll speak to your master about this.” He lunged to grab Baoyu. Right then, Qin Zhong emerged, only to be blindsided by a flying ink-slab from behind. It missed its intended target, striking the seat shared by Jia Lan and Jia Jun—two younger scions from the Rong Mansion. Jia Jun, motherless and doted upon by his grandmother, was extremely headstrong. Seated with Jia Lan, he saw that the slab whirled astray, crashing near them, inking their table. Outraged, he spat, “You rascals are playing rough.” He grabbed a second slab, intending to fling it. Jia Lan, mild-tempered, tried to hold him back. But Jia Jun, unstoppable, flung a wooden book box, which landed on Baoyu and Qin Zhong’s desk, scattering texts and smashing a teacup—tea spraying everywhere. Jia Jun leapt forward, vowing to thrash whoever threw that ink-slab. Jin Rong, seeing the bedlam, snatched a long bamboo board. The place was tight, children crowded, so the flailing board met an onslaught from Mingyan, already stung by a blow and yelling, “Why just stand around? Attack!” Baoyu’s other pages—Sweepred, Chowyao, Muyu—none were mild by nature. They all howled, “Take him down!” snatching rods or whips and converging with eager chaos. Jia Rui dashed in, trying to hold one, scold another, to no avail. Some in the room joined in punching or cheering, others cowered out of sight. The scene devolved into pandemonium.

Hearing the uproar, several major servants like Li Gui rushed inside, bellowing for order. Seizing the fighters, they demanded, “What’s going on?” Everyone shouted at once. Each told a different version. Li Gui scolded Mingyan and his three cohorts, chasing them outside. Meanwhile, Qin Zhong’s forehead had bashed into Jin Rong’s board, scraping off a patch of skin. Baoyu held his coat to it, dabbing at the wound. Seeing the scuffle quelled, he declared, “Li Gui, gather my books and ready a horse! I’m going to report to Master at once. We’re being bullied; we tried telling Cousin Rui, but he took their side, letting them shout insults and gang up on us. Mingyan saw them pressing me, so of course he stepped in. They battered him, plus my friend’s head. Is there any studying to be done here?” Li Gui attempted to calm him: “Young Master, please, the Master is busy at home. Over something so small, do we really want to alarm him, looking as though we can’t handle minor trouble? In my humble view, the best approach is to settle it here. Why trouble the elders? The fault is indeed with Master Rui—when the Master isn’t present, you’re effectively in charge, yet he let them cause mayhem. He should have intervened.” Jia Rui said, “I tried shouting for order, but they wouldn’t listen!” Li Gui rebuked, “With all respect, sir, there’ve been times your own conduct has put these boys in no mood to listen to you. If you let this escalate to the Master, you’ll also be held responsible. Best we settle it quietly right now.” Baoyu insisted, “I refuse. I’ll go anyway.” Qin Zhong, weeping, said, “With Jin Rong still here, I refuse to stay.” Baoyu said, “Why should we yield? I’ll speak to everyone—he must go. At the very least, we must expel him.” Then he asked Li Gui, “Which branch does Jin Rong come from?” Li Gui paused, “No need to ask. Let’s not drag the entire lineage in. That stirs more conflict.” From outside, Mingyan shouted, “He’s nephew to Mistress Huang in the East Mansion. Does that give him any right to posture? Mistress Huang? She’s forever bowing to our Second Mistress Lian, begging loans. Why respect such an aunt, anyway?” Li Gui snapped, “Mind your mouth, you little miscreant! You want me to thrash you first and then report to the Master, saying all this was your instigation? We’re lucky enough we managed to calm things halfway, and here you fan the flames again!” Thus scolded, Mingyan fell quiet.

Jia Rui, fearing repercussions for himself, pleaded with Qin Zhong and Baoyu to remain, promising to broker peace. They refused at first, but Baoyu finally relented: “All right, then let him apologize to Qin Zhong.” Jin Rong balked. Pressed by Jia Rui, he continued to resist. The others—desperate for resolution—implored him, “In fairness, you started it. If you won’t apologize, how can this end?” Backed into a corner, Jin Rong offered a small bow to Qin Zhong. Baoyu, unsatisfied, demanded a full prostration. Jia Rui only wanted to end the crisis, so he quietly urged Jin Rong, “Endure a moment’s humiliation for lasting peace.”
Whether Jin Rong complied or not shall be revealed in the next chapter.
CHAPTER 10

Widow Jin Greedily Seeks Advantage and Suffers Humiliation;
Doctor Zhang Diagnoses the Illness and Probes Its Deeper Source

When Jin Rong, forced by superior numbers and by Jia Rui’s orders, apologized and bowed his head to Qin Zhong, only then did Baoyu finally cease his clamor. They dismissed classes for the day. Jin Rong went home, still brooding over the incident. He fumed inwardly: “Qin Zhong is nothing but Jia Rong’s brother-in-law, not even a true Jia descendant. Enrolling in our school is no different from how I joined. Just because he relies on Baoyu’s favor, he thinks he can ignore everyone else. If he were truly respectable, that’d be one thing—but he’s always sneaking around with Baoyu, as if nobody can see. Today he crossed my path at the worst time, and I caught him red-handed. Even if trouble arises, what do I have to fear?”

His mother, Madam Hu, overheard him grumbling and asked, “Why get mixed up in others’ business? We spent so much effort so your aunt could speak on your behalf. She tried every means before your cousin’s wife in the West Mansion, which is how you landed this opportunity to attend school. Without their backing, how could we afford a tutor? Besides, at that school you get your tea and meals, so our household saves considerable expense. That saving lets you wear decent clothing. Furthermore, if you weren’t at that school, you’d never have met Master Xue. But thanks to Master Xue’s generosity, we gain seventy or eighty taels of silver yearly. If you cause trouble and get kicked out, trying to find another place like that would be harder than climbing to the heavens. So curb your temper, amuse yourself quietly, and go to bed.” With that, Jin Rong smothered his resentment and soon turned in for the night. The next day he returned to school as usual, and the matter seemed to rest there.

His aunt was married into the “Yu” generation of a more distant Jia branch, named Jia Huang. That side of the clan never enjoyed the wealth and prestige of the Ning and Rong mansions—no need to detail. Jia Huang and his wife lived on meager property. Periodically they paid visits of respect to the Ning and Rong households, as well as to Wang Xifeng and You-shi, receiving occasional financial help from them. One bright morning, free from other affairs, Huang’s wife decided to bring along a servant woman and ride by cart to see her sister-in-law and nephew. In conversation, Jin Rong’s mother inevitably mentioned the clash at the Jia family school the day before, recounting it all from start to finish. Upon hearing this, Jia Huang’s wife instantly took offense: “So Qin Zhong, that brat of Jia Rong’s in-laws, is that much bigger a figure than our nephew? Are they the only ones allowed any clout in the Jia clan? Besides, the sort of business they’re doing hardly warrants such arrogance. Even Baoyu, why should he side with him to that extent? Let me go straight to the East Mansion to see Madame Zhen or that Qin sister, and ask them what’s fair!” Jin Rong’s mother grew alarmed: “Aunt, I was just talking too freely. Please do not mention it! Right or wrong, if a fuss breaks out, our nephew will lose his spot at that school. Then not only can we not afford a tutor, but we’ll face all kinds of trouble!” Jia Huang’s wife retorted, “Who cares? I’ll have my say and see what happens.” She ignored her sister-in-law’s protest, ordered the servant woman to ready the cart, and proceeded directly to the Ning Mansion.

Arriving at Ning Mansion, she entered via the eastern corner gate, dismounted, and went in to see You-shi. She concealed her anger for the moment, greeting with every courtesy. After idle pleasantries, she inquired, “Why hasn’t your daughter-in-law, Madam Rong, come out today?” You-shi explained, “These days she’s been unwell. Her monthly cycle vanished for two months, so we summoned doctors to check. They say it’s definitely not pregnancy, yet each afternoon she can barely stir or speak, her spirit dulled. I told her: ‘Don’t burden yourself with formalities. You needn’t greet visitors morning and night as usual. Just rest. If any relative or friend comes, let me handle it. If older family members blame you, I’ll explain.’ I also instructed my son, ‘You are not to trouble her or make her upset. Let her keep calm for a few days, and perhaps she’ll improve. If she craves anything, she can come take it from my quarters. If anything should happen to her, where would we find such a graceful, kindly young wife again? Everyone in our extended family loves her. So I’m terribly anxious. Meanwhile, there’s no decent physician at hand. I’m at my wits’ end. Then to make matters worse, just this morning her younger brother arrived, telling her about some fight in the school—a bunch of worthless trouble. He said those rascals even made filthy insinuations. That upset her further. She’s offended that her brother won’t focus on his studies, giving the troublemakers room to create drama. On hearing that, she couldn’t bring herself to eat a single bite. I tried comforting her, advised her brother to go over to the West Mansion and speak with Baoyu. Eventually I coaxed her into swallowing half a cup of bird’s-nest broth before I came out to greet you. Sister, am I not frantic? And the doctors we employ nowadays, worthless all—listening to hints, echoing them with fancy words, or huddling four at a time each day, prescribing nothing effective. So she must dress and undress many times a day for them to check her, and none of it helps.”

Huang’s wife listened, stunned, all the anger she’d brought draining away. Then, seeing You-shi’s distress, she hastened to say, “I’ve never heard of any truly skilled doctors. But by the sound of it, your daughter-in-law might actually be pregnant. You might not want them randomly medicating her—what if the treatment goes wrong?” You-shi said, “Yes, that worries me too.” While they spoke, Jia Zhen entered. Seeing Huang’s wife, he asked You-shi, “Isn’t this Sister Huang?” She rose and greeted him, and he politely urged, “Sister, please stay for a meal.” Then he withdrew into another room, leaving them to converse. Huang’s wife had meant to lodge complaints on her nephew’s behalf, but now, learning of the young wife’s illness, plus seeing how courteous Jia Zhen and You-shi were, she felt it inappropriate to voice her grievance. Instead, she exchanged friendly chatter and soon took her leave.

After her departure, Jia Zhen returned to sit beside You-shi, inquiring, “What did she want?” You-shi answered, “Nothing special. She arrived somewhat vexed, but after hearing about our daughter-in-law’s trouble, she calmed down, then left once we invited her to stay for dinner. Meanwhile, about our daughter-in-law’s condition—how shall we find a decent doctor? Our usual ones are worthless.” Jia Zhen said, “Indeed, these so-called doctors rely on hints, parrot them with fancy talk. It’s all nonsense. Our daughter-in-law has grown weaker day by day, and not one of them has been helpful. Actually, just now I spoke with Feng Ziying. He asked why I seemed upset, so I told him of my worries about my son’s wife. Feng said there’s an acquaintance of his—a scholar named Zhang You-shi—extremely learned, with a deep mastery of medicine. He’s up in the capital lodging at Feng’s house while arranging an official post for his son. Feng strongly recommended him. I already sent a servant with my card requesting a visit. Possibly it’s too late today, but he might come tomorrow. Feng Ziying also promised to speak to him personally. If so, our daughter-in-law’s affliction might finally meet its match.” Hearing this, You-shi felt relieved. Then she asked, “The day after tomorrow is Father’s birthday. What’s the plan?” Jia Zhen replied, “I went to pay respects to Father just now, inviting him to the mansion so the entire family could offer their congratulations. He answered: ‘I prefer my quiet. I have no desire to enter the swirl of commotion there. If you must mark my birthday, do something else useful. For instance, you can take that old text I once annotated—“On the Hidden Virtue”—and have it properly copied and engraved. That would be better than a day of hollow bows. If any family members come to see me, you host them in your own home. No need to send me gifts. And you needn’t appear on my actual birthday. If you arrive with a noisy crowd that day, I won’t receive you at all.’ So, I didn’t dare press. I figure we’ll just give a decent banquet for two days to welcome visiting relatives. Meanwhile, we’ll let Father have his peace.” Summoning Lai Sheng, Jia Zhen instructed him to arrange the banquet as usual for those two days.

You-shi told Jia Rong, “Tell Lai Sheng to prepare a generous banquet. Then go invite Grandmother, the Elder Mistress, the Second Mistress, and your Aunt Lian in the West Mansion to join the festivities for a while. Also, your father found an excellent physician who should come tomorrow—explain your wife’s symptoms in detail.” Jia Rong nodded and departed. He encountered the servant returning from Feng Ziying’s house, who reported, “Master Feng introduced your father’s letter to Mister Zhang. He said, ‘Yesterday our Master told me of your situation, but after a full day of social calls, I’m quite drained. If I go now, I couldn’t even check a pulse properly. I must rest tonight, but tomorrow I’ll surely come. I hesitate to accept Master Jia’s calling card, but under these circumstances, I have no choice.’ Then he had me bring your father’s card back.” Jia Rong went to inform Jia Zhen and You-shi, who felt pleased by the news. Jia Zhen instructed, “When that gentleman arrives, we’ll see if our daughter-in-law’s illness can finally be cured. The prescription alone should reassure us. We even have that fine ginseng we bought the other day—use that if required.” Having received these instructions, Jia Rong oversaw the procurement of medicines.

The next day at midday, the gate servants returned with the message: “Doctor Zhang is here.” Jia Zhen welcomed him into the front hall, invited him for tea, and said, “Yesterday Master Feng told me of your outstanding learning, including a profound knowledge of medicine. I’m deeply grateful you’ve come.” Zhang responded, “I’m an unremarkable fellow, lacking true expertise. Master Feng nonetheless mentioned me, and when your house called, I dared not refuse. I fear I have limited skill.” Jia Zhen replied, “No need for modesty, sir. Please examine my daughter-in-law, that we might set our hearts at ease.” He asked Jia Rong to guide the doctor inside. The moment they stepped into the inner room, facing Qin-shi, Jia Rong suggested, “Sir, let me first describe my wife’s ailments before you check her pulse.” The doctor said, “In my opinion, it’s best I first take her pulse, then hear the details. I must confess, I came only because Master Feng so insisted, and because of your courtesy. Once I check the pulse, we’ll see if my assessment matches reality, and then we can decide if there’s a suitable prescription.” Jia Rong concurred, “Indeed, sir, I only wish to know if her illness is treatable, so our elders can rest easy.” Several serving women placed a pillow to support Qin-shi, rolling up her sleeve to reveal her wrist. The doctor extended his hand, holding her right wrist, slowing his breath as he carefully felt the pulse. After a while, he switched to the left wrist, again studying it in silence for quite some time. Then he nodded, “Let us move outside to talk.”

So Jia Rong escorted him to the outer sitting room, where they took seats on the kang. A maid served tea, which Zhang sipped. Jia Rong asked, “Sir, can her illness be cured?” Zhang answered, “From feeling her pulses: the left cun is deep and rapid, the left guan deep and muted; the right cun is fine and weak, the right guan empty and lacking spirit. A deep, rapid left cun means deficiency of the heart’s qi giving rise to fire; a deep, muted left guan means a deficit of the liver’s blood and obstructed energy. A fine, weak right cun shows the lung meridian is too frail in its qi; the empty, spiritless right guan suggests the spleen is being overpowered by the liver. If the heart’s qi is deficient and becomes fire, that aligns with an irregular menses and insomnia at night. The blood deficiency and stagnation in the liver manifest as delays in monthly discharge, plus heat in the chest. Lungs lacking qi might lead to dizziness and cold sweats at dawn, as if drifting on a boat. The spleen subdued by the liver presumably means loss of appetite, fatigue, and aching limbs. Judging by her pulse, these must be her symptoms—and obviously not the signs of pregnancy. I don’t believe it’s a case of carrying a child.”

A serving woman exclaimed, “Exactly so—everything you described is what she has. Countless official physicians have visited, none diagnosing so precisely. Some say she’s pregnant; some say she’s simply ill; some say it matters not. No one makes sense. Sir, you must save her.” The doctor continued, “It seems the illness was allowed to advance. If it had been addressed when she first began menstruating—nurturing her heart, regulating her qi—this would never have worsened so. Even so, in my view, she still has a thirty-percent chance. Let me prescribe a remedy. If she can sleep better at night, we’ll boost that chance further. From her pulses, I deduce she’s a refined, strong-minded woman, supremely intelligent. Yet supreme intelligence often leads to frequent frustration, and frustration leads to overthinking, thus harming the spleen and inflaming the liver. That in turn disrupts monthly cycles. I suspect she’s always had extended intervals, never shortened. Correct?” The maid nodded, “Indeed so. She never once had an abbreviated cycle—always delayed, sometimes two or three days, or even ten. She’s never on time.” The doctor said, “Yes, that’s the crux. If earlier she’d taken medication to calm her heart and regulate her energy, she’d be fine by now. Now the situation is clearly water depletion and fire excess. I will try a prescription. We’ll see how it goes. If she manages to sleep through the night after taking it, that means progress. Otherwise it depends on her alignment with fate. But in my best estimation, she should be safe this winter. By next spring equinox, we might see full recovery.” Jia Rong, satisfied, refrained from pressing further.

He then escorted the doctor outside, thanked him with formal courtesies, and took the prescription to show Jia Zhen. The note read:

Nourish the Qi, Foster the Nutrients, Fortify the Spleen, and Harmonize the Liver Decoction
Ginseng (2 qian)
White Atractylodes, stir-fried (2 qian)
Poria (3 qian)
Cooked Rehmannia (4 qian)
Angelica sinensis (2 qian)
White Peony (2 qian)
Chuanxiong (1.5 qian)
Astragalus (3 qian)
Fragrant Cyperus (2 qian)
Vinegar-processed Chaihu (8 fen)
Huai Yam, stir-fried (2 qian)
True Donkey-Hide Gelatin (2 qian)
Yanhu Suo, wine-fried (1.5 qian)
Roasted Licorice (8 fen)
Boil with seven lotus seeds (skinned) and two jujubes
Reporting this to Jia Zhen and You-shi, Jia Rong repeated the doctor’s words. You-shi told Jia Zhen, “This man’s approach is so direct—he must be competent.” Jia Zhen said, “He’s neither a quack nor a veteran of flattering the powerful, only here because Feng Ziying prevailed upon him. With luck, our daughter-in-law’s ailment can be cured. The prescription includes ginseng. Let’s use that premium batch we purchased.” Jia Rong relayed instructions to fill the prescription. A messenger prepared the herbs, and they cooked it for Qin-shi to try. We wait to see how she responds to the remedy and whether her affliction improves. That will be told in the chapter to come.
CHAPTER 11

In Celebrating a Birthday, the Ning Mansion Stages a Family Feast;
Seeing Wang Xifeng, Jia Rui Is Seized with Lust

On this day, it was the birthday of Jia Jing. Earlier, Jia Zhen had ordered that choice foods and rare fruits be packed into sixteen large gift boxes, directing Jia Rong to present them to Jia Jing. He reminded Jia Rong: “Watch whether Grandfather likes them. Once you’ve greeted him, say, ‘Father is following Grandfather’s instructions and dares not come in person, remaining at home to host our entire family, who have all solemnly offered their respects.’” Jia Rong duly agreed and left with some family retainers.

Meanwhile, activity was already stirring at the mansion. First, Jia Lian and Jia Qiang arrived to inspect seating arrangements and inquire, “What sort of entertainment is prepared?” A servant answered, “Our Master had originally planned to invite the Elder Master here today, so we hadn’t dared prepare amusements. Only when we heard late that the Elder Master wouldn’t come did we hastily gather a small troupe and a ‘ten-piece band’ for percussive music, all set up on the garden stage.” Later, Lady Xing, Lady Wang, Wang Xifeng, and Baoyu arrived, and Jia Zhen, along with You-shi, received them. You-shi’s mother had arrived earlier, so everyone exchanged greetings and took their seats. Jia Zhen and You-shi presented them with tea, then addressed the gathering with a laugh, “Our grandfather is advanced in age and has become like a hermit, so for his birthday we dared not trouble him to come. We had only meant for him to see us gathered merrily and for our venerable ancestor to take pleasure. But, not surprisingly, he declined.” Wang Xifeng, anticipating Lady Wang’s silence, interjected, “Yesterday Grandmother actually said she would come, but last night she saw Baoyu eating peaches and got tempted, so she ate over half a peach herself. By the fifth watch, she rose twice in the night, leaving her rather tired this morning. She told me to tell you she truly cannot manage it today, but she would like a few morsels prepared—softer foods.” Jia Zhen smiled, “I knew Grandmother enjoyed a bit of lively fun. If she doesn’t come, there must be a reason. So that is it.”

Lady Wang asked, “I recall your eldest daughter-in-law mentioning that your son Rong’s wife had not been feeling well. How is she now?” You-shi explained, “Her illness appeared in a strange way. Mid-autumn last month, she stayed up half the night playing with Grandmother and your ladyships, seemingly fine. But after the twentieth, she grew more sluggish daily, eating less, for nearly half a month now. Her monthly cycle has gone missing for two months.” Lady Xing suggested, “Could it be pregnancy?” Just then a servant outside announced, “The Eldest Master, the Second Master, and all the gentlemen of the family have arrived and are in the main hall.” Jia Zhen hurried off to greet them, leaving You-shi to continue: “Previously some doctors did suspect she was pregnant. Yesterday, Feng Ziying introduced us to a man who was once his childhood tutor, skilled in letters and medicine alike. After diagnosing her, he insists it’s not pregnancy but a major ailment. He prescribed a remedy yesterday, and after one dose, she’s a bit less dizzy, but little else has changed.” Wang Xifeng added, “She’s never been one to give in easily. On a day like this, if she were at all able, she’d be here among us.” You-shi said, “Yes, you saw her here on the third, when she forced herself to stay up. That was because of her affection for you. But now she’s too weak even for that.” Hearing this, Wang Xifeng’s eyes reddened and she sighed, “Heaven’s changes come without warning, and mortal destiny is so fragile. If, at her young age, this illness worsens—what’s left in life to enjoy?”

As they spoke, Jia Rong arrived, greeting Lady Xing, Lady Wang, and Wang Xifeng, then reported to You-shi: “I delivered the food to Grandfather and repeated Father’s words that he was hosting the family on behalf of Grandfather. He received it gladly, praising Father for obeying his instructions, telling me to pass on that he hopes Father and Mother will kindly look after the lords and ladies here. He also said we must urgently print and distribute thousands of copies of that ‘Treatise on Hidden Virtue’ he once annotated. I told Father, who was delighted. For now, I must rejoin the gentlemen and handle the feast.” Wang Xifeng addressed Jia Rong: “Nephew, what’s your wife’s condition today?” Jia Rong wrinkled his brow. “Not any better, Aunt. See for yourself.” With that, he left to oversee the men. Inside, You-shi turned to Lady Xing, Lady Wang, “Where would you like to dine? Here, or in the garden, where a small theatrical troupe is ready?” Lady Wang consulted Lady Xing, who said, “Right here will do.” So You-shi gave orders for the feast to be served. At once, servants set out the table. She and her mother ushered Lady Xing, Lady Wang, and the others to sit. Wang Xifeng, Baoyu, and You-shi took slightly lower seats. Lady Xing and Lady Wang commented, “We came for Eldest Master’s birthday, yet it’s as though we ourselves are celebrating.” Wang Xifeng laughed, “The Elder Master is a quiet soul, almost a perfected immortal. If you say it’s ‘heart to spirit, spirit perceives,’ it’s not far off.” The remark made everyone in the room laugh.

When You-shi’s mother, Lady Xing, Lady Wang, and Wang Xifeng finished their meal and rinsed their hands, they talked of strolling in the garden. Jia Rong arrived: “All the uncles and cousins have eaten. The Eldest Master says there’s business at home, and the Second Master does not fancy noisy performances, so they both departed. Others have gone with Cousin Lian and Cousin Qiang to watch the play. Earlier, the four princes—Southern Peace, Eastern Peace, Western Tranquility, and Northern Serenity—and also the Duke of Zhen’s mansion, plus six or seven more families like the Loyal and Tranquil Marquisate of the Shi clan—all sent birthday gifts with their name cards. Father has received them in the accounts office, giving each messenger a receipt and a proper meal.” You-shi nodded, “Then let’s please escort these ladies to the garden. The play is underway.” Wang Xifeng spoke up: “I’d like to check on Rong’s wife, then join you.” Lady Wang concurred, “Yes, go see how she is. We might go too, but fear that it might bother her. Just tell her we’re thinking of her.” You-shi said, “Yes, Sister, you’re the one she trusts—do try comforting her. Then please come back quickly to the garden.” Baoyu wanted to accompany Wang Xifeng. Lady Wang cautioned, “Only a nephew’s wife—no need for you to linger. Greet her, then come join us.” So while You-shi led her mother and the other ladies toward the Hall of Assembled Fragrance in the garden, Wang Xifeng and Baoyu followed Jia Rong to Qin-shi’s quarters.

They entered quietly into the inner room. Qin-shi rose to greet them, but Wang Xifeng urged, “Stay as you are, too much movement might make you dizzy.” She quickly stepped forward, holding Qin-shi’s hand. “Dear sister, how have these few days treated you? You’ve grown so thin!” They sat on a cushion together, while Baoyu asked politely after her health from a nearby chair. Jia Rong called out, “Serve tea for my aunt and second uncle.” Qin-shi, forcing a smile, began: “I’m just unlucky. This wonderful family has treated me like a daughter, Father- and Mother-in-law cherishing me, plus you and Nephew Baoyu so kind in every way, not once cross with me. Indeed, not a soul here has slighted me. Yet now I’m stricken by this illness. My self-confidence is gone. I’ve hardly repaid any of their kindness. And if, at such a young age, I—well, I fear I cannot hold out much longer.”

Baoyu, meanwhile, had glanced toward the “Spring Slumber Beneath the Crabapple Blossoms” painting and the couplet reading “A faint chill locks the dream in early spring cold; The drifting fragrance intoxicates like wine.” It recalled his nap here once, dreaming of the “Great Void Illusion Realm.” He drifted into reverie, but Qin-shi’s words about her nearing death cut him to the heart, bringing him to tears. Wang Xifeng, too, felt deep sorrow, but she worried that showing it might upset Qin-shi further. So she said, “Cousin, you’re overthinking. It’s not that serious. Besides, you’re still young—some rest and the right treatment, and you’ll recover.” Jia Rong added, “Indeed, all you need is to regain appetite.” Worrying that Baoyu might sadden her further, Wang Xifeng said, “Baoyu, your mother wanted you in the garden. Don’t linger and trouble Sister’s mind. The Lady will worry too. Let’s be off.” She turned to Jia Rong, “Why not escort Baoyu there first? I’ll stay a moment with your wife.” Jia Rong did as told. Baoyu bid Qin-shi goodbye and followed.

Once alone, Wang Xifeng comforted Qin-shi with hushed and kind words. After a while, messages came twice or thrice from You-shi summoning her to the garden. Finally, Wang Xifeng said, “Take good care—thanks to that skilled new doctor, I’m sure you’ll be fine.” Qin-shi, forcing a sad smile, replied, “Even if he’s a divine healer, he can cure illness but not destiny. I just sense it’s all day-by-day now.” Wang Xifeng rose, swallowing her tears, saying, “If you keep such a mindset, how can you improve? But the doctor said if it were left alone, spring might be the dangerous time. We can afford as much ginseng as needed, so keep up your strength. I’ll head to the garden now.” Qin-shi murmured another farewell, “Aunt, do visit me again when free.” Wang Xifeng, with reddening eyes, said, “Certainly I shall.”

With a few women, Wang Xifeng walked out a side gate into the garden. She noticed:

“Yellow blooms carpeted the ground, white willows draped the slopes.
A small bridge spanned what seemed the Ruoye Stream; winding paths stretched like roads to Mount Tiantai.
Rocky outcroppings channeled trickling water; fences exuded floral fragrance.
The trees bore fluttering red leaves, the sparse woods resembled a painting.
The western wind, though blowing briskly, still carried a warbler’s note;
The mild sun, shining warmly, now encountered silent watchers.
East and south, pavilions rose near the hills; west and north, gazebos perched above the water.
Music resonated everywhere, setting a dreamy mood;
Bedecked figures wandered among the trees, enhancing the scene’s charm.”
Wang Xifeng admired the scenic walk, stepping slowly. Suddenly, from behind a false rock, someone emerged and greeted her: “Greetings, dear Sister-in-law.” Wang Xifeng jumped, stepping back, “Isn’t this Cousin Rui?” Indeed it was Jia Rui, who said, “Sister-in-law, you don’t recognize me?” She replied, “Not that I don’t know you—just startled to see you here.” Jia Rui said, “We must be destined to meet. I slipped out from the feast for a quiet stroll, not expecting to run into you. Surely that’s fate.” While speaking, he stared intently at Wang Xifeng.

Wang Xifeng was shrewd enough to see his intent. She feigned a gentle laugh: “No wonder your older brother always praises you as bright. Hearing just these few words, I see you’re clever and agreeable. I’d linger to chat, but I must greet the ladies. Let’s find a better time.” Jia Rui said, “I’d come calling at your place, but you’re so young, I feared you might refuse me.” Wang Xifeng, still putting on a kindly façade, said, “We’re all one family—why talk of youth or age?” The statement thrilled Jia Rui. “Who’d have guessed I’d have such fortune today?” His thoughts churned with improper longing. Wang Xifeng said, “You’d best return to the feast, or they’ll punish you with extra wine.” Jia Rui, half in a daze, strolled away, glancing over his shoulder. Wang Xifeng slowed her pace as if ensuring he was gone, secretly thinking: “So this is how shameless he is! I must find a chance to handle him, or he’ll never learn.”

Soon, she turned a corner and saw two or three servant women rushing toward her. Spotting Wang Xifeng, they said, “Our Mistress has been waiting anxiously, so we came to fetch you.” Wang Xifeng remarked, “Your Mistress is always so impatient.” Proceeding at a leisurely pace, she asked, “How many scenes have been performed?” A maid answered, “About eight or nine.” They soon reached the rear gate of the Tianxiang Tower, where Baoyu and some maids were idling. Wang Xifeng called, “Baoyu, don’t be so wild.” A maid added, “The ladies are upstairs. Please follow these steps.” Wang Xifeng climbed calmly. Near the stair landing, You-shi was waiting. “You two are so inseparable,” she teased, “You didn’t come all this time?” Wang Xifeng smiled: “We parted only briefly. I had a few words with her. Then I left to see Sister-in-law.” She then came in and saluted Lady Wang and Lady Xing. You-shi handed her the playbill, inviting her to choose. Wang Xifeng demurred, “The ladies are here—I wouldn’t dare choose.” Lady Xing and Lady Wang urged, “We and your mother-in-law already picked several pieces. Why not add a few yourself?” So Wang Xifeng rose, flipping through the playbill. She named “Return of the Soul” and “Narrative Ballad.” Returning the list, she said, “After they finish The Paired Imperial Edicts, let’s do these two. That should suffice.” Lady Wang nodded, “Yes, let’s not stay too late.” You-shi tried to keep them longer: “Spend more time here—the weather is mild.” Wang Xifeng glanced down from the tower, “Where did all the gentlemen go?” Someone answered, “They moved to the Pavilion of Condensed Sunshine, with a ‘ten-piece band,’ enjoying wine.” Wang Xifeng remarked, “They certainly fled here so they can fool around in private!” You-shi laughed, “They aren’t as proper as you.”

They joked until the chosen operas ended. Then attendants cleared the table for dinner. They ate, afterward returning to the main house for tea. Finally, they summoned their carriage. Bidding farewell to You-shi’s mother, they left. As You-shi, along with a group of maids and concubines, escorted them to the carriage, Jia Zhen and other male kin stood waiting. Jia Zhen proposed, “Aunt, come tomorrow, too.” Lady Wang declined, “We’ve had enough excitement for one day—let’s rest.” Everyone boarded and left. Jia Rui, lingering in the background, kept darting glances at Wang Xifeng. Once Jia Zhen departed, Li Gui readied a horse for Baoyu, who rode alongside Lady Wang’s carriage.

Jia Zhen and the men continued feasting. At day’s end they dispersed. The next day was similarly lively. After that, Wang Xifeng periodically visited Qin-shi, finding her sometimes marginally better, sometimes worse, which alarmed Jia Zhen, You-shi, and Jia Rong.

Meanwhile, Jia Rui made several attempts to visit the Rong Mansion but was thwarted each time because Wang Xifeng was off at the Ning Mansion. That year, at the close of the eleventh lunar month, it was nearly Winter Solstice. As the date approached, Grandmother Jia, Lady Wang, and Wang Xifeng sent daily inquiries after Qin-shi. The replies: “No deterioration, but no improvement.” Lady Wang told Grandmother Jia, “Given her condition, if she can get through this transitional day without worsening, there’s hope.” Grandmother Jia sighed, “Poor child, so young—if anything goes wrong, how can we bear it?” With that, she told Wang Xifeng, “Once New Year’s Day is past, you might see how she’s doing. If she’s stable, report back. She used to enjoy certain foods—send them along.” Wang Xifeng agreed.

On the second day of the new moon, finishing her morning meal, Wang Xifeng headed for the Ning Mansion. She found Qin-shi unchanged: less dizzy but overall still fragile. Wang Xifeng sat with her for half the day, exchanging mild words of cheer, mentioning that her condition was manageable. Qin-shi responded, “By spring we’ll know. Winter has passed with little change—maybe I’ll yet be cured. Yesterday I ate two small squares of lotus-seed cake Grandmother sent. I handled them fine.” Wang Xifeng reassured her, “I’ll have more sent. Right now, I must speak with your mother-in-law and hurry back to tell Grandmother.” Qin-shi said, “Please convey my humble regards to Grandmother and Lady Wang. If in a day or two I feel stronger, I’ll go to them myself.” Wang Xifeng agreed, stepping out to see You-shi in her main quarters. There, she asked, “Sister-in-law’s condition?” Wang Xifeng sighed, “It looks bad. You might prepare quietly. Even a light measure, to counter ill fortune, might help.” You-shi nodded, “I’ve discreetly arranged some things, except the coffin boards. It’s tough finding top-quality wood quickly, but we’re working on it.” Wang Xifeng said, “I’m leaving to inform Grandmother. She’ll be anxious.” Then she departed.

Arriving home, Wang Xifeng reported to Grandmother Jia: “Rong’s wife sends her respects, saying she’s a bit better. She asked Grandmother not to worry, and that if she improves further, she’ll come herself.” Grandmother Jia said, “What do your eyes tell you?” Wang Xifeng replied, “She’s not too bad—her spirits are okay.” Grandmother Jia fell silent for a moment. “All right, go change your clothes and rest.” Wang Xifeng, curtsying, left to see Lady Wang, and then went to her own rooms. Ping’er brought out a warmed house robe, helping her change. Wang Xifeng sat sipping tea, asking, “Any news at home?” Ping’er replied, “Nothing major. That three hundred taels of interest money came in; Wang’er’s wife delivered it. I accepted it. Also, Cousin Rui sent a message, inquiring whether you were home, saying he planned to call.” Wang Xifeng snorted, “That creature is courting his own demise. Let’s see what he wants!” Ping’er asked, “Why does he pester you so often?” Wang Xifeng told her of that encounter in the garden of Ning Mansion, where Jia Rui’s words and behavior revealed his shameless desire. Ping’er exclaimed, “A toad lusting after a swan—an immoral wretch. He deserves a dreadful end!” Wang Xifeng said, “I’ll handle him if he comes again.”

But what happens when Jia Rui arrives, we must see in the next chapter.
CHAPTER 12

Wang Xifeng Lays a Deadly Trap of Desire;
Jia Tianxiang, Facing the Mirror of Love and Lust

On that day, Wang Xifeng was talking with Ping’er when someone came in to report, “Young Master Rui is here.” Wishing to see how far he would go, she said, “Invite him in.” Jia Rui, overjoyed at being invited, entered to greet Wang Xifeng with a broad smile, repeatedly inquiring after her well-being. Wang Xifeng pretended a warm welcome, urging him to sit and offering him tea. Seeing her adorned so enchantingly, Jia Rui felt his self-control crumble. With half-lidded eyes, he asked, “Is Second Brother not yet back?” Wang Xifeng responded, “For some unknown reason, no.” Jia Rui laughed, “He must be snared somewhere on the road, unwilling to return.” Wang Xifeng teased, “Men fall in love at each turn—some are like that.” Jia Rui quickly said, “That doesn’t describe me. I’m not that kind of man.” Wang Xifeng smiled, “Yes, you’re unlike others. Out of ten, you’d be the only one.” Elated, Jia Rui began squirming in delight and resumed, “I assume you spend your days bored.” Wang Xifeng sighed, “That’s true enough—I keep wishing for someone to chat with and pass the time.” Jia Rui said eagerly, “I’m idle all day. If I come each day to relieve your boredom, how would that be?” Wang Xifeng exclaimed, “Don’t tease me. Would you actually come? I suspect you wouldn’t want to see me.” Jia Rui declared, “If a single word from me proves false, let lightning strike me! People call you fierce, saying no one dares make the slightest slip in your presence, so I was frightened. Only now I see you’re sweet-tempered, so gentle, and you truly take pity on people—how could I not come, even at the risk of my life?” Wang Xifeng replied, “Indeed, you’re truly wise, far better than those two blockheads, Rong and Lian. I used to think them bright, but they know nothing of what’s in a person’s heart.”

Those words resonated perfectly with Jia Rui, who crept closer, eyes fixed on her embroidered pouch, while casually asking, “What sort of rings are you wearing?” Wang Xifeng softly admonished, “Compose yourself. Don’t let the maids notice.” Jia Rui, as if receiving a sacred command, hastily scooted back. Wang Xifeng chuckled, “Time you went.” Jia Rui protested, “Let me sit a bit longer—how cruel you are, Sister-in-law!” Wang Xifeng leaned in, whispering, “With so many people coming and going in broad daylight, your presence here is risky. Better go for now. Tonight, after the watch has begun, come quietly to the western corner passage, and wait for me.” Jia Rui’s heart soared, “You’re not deceiving me? But that passage is busy—where can I hide?” Wang Xifeng said, “Rest assured, I’ll give the night guards leave. I’ll lock both gates. Then no one else will be around.” Jia Rui brimmed with joy and hastened away, convinced he’d finally triumph.

He burned with impatience for night to fall. Yet his household matters delayed him. By the time he slipped away, darkness had settled. He waited until his grandfather was abed, then sneaked into the Rong Mansion, slipping into that connecting corridor. Indeed, it was pitch-black, and no one passed by. The door connecting to Grandmother Jia’s side was shut, while the east door remained ajar. Jia Rui crouched there for ages without seeing anyone. Suddenly, with a thud, the east door was barred from outside. Alarmed, he dared not make a sound but tested the door; it was fastened like iron. And from the inside, only high walls to the north and south. No chance to climb or leap over. The corridor, meanwhile, became a wind tunnel. In the twelfth month’s bitter cold, that long winter’s night nearly finished him off. Surviving ‘til daybreak, he at last heard footsteps. An old matron entered from the east door to open the west door. With her back turned, Jia Rui dashed past, hugging himself from the cold. He managed to slip out the back gate, unobserved, then hurried home before dawn.

Jia Rui’s father and mother were both deceased, so he was reared by his grandfather, Jia Dairu, a rigorous tutor. He forbade Jia Rui from wandering, fearing gambling, drunkenness, or general debauchery. Seeing him fail to return all night, Jia Dairu assumed he’d been out carousing. He was furious, though never suspecting the real cause. Jia Rui, terrified, fabricated a story: “I visited my maternal uncle, got caught by darkness, and had to spend the night.” Dairu thundered, “You’ve always sought permission before going anywhere—why sneak off this time? And now you lie! That alone deserves a beating.” So he had Jia Rui pinned down and flogged thirty or forty strokes, then forbade him meals, ordering him to kneel in the courtyard reading Confucian texts until he produced ten days’ backlog of lessons. Jia Rui, already half-frozen from the corridor, was now bruised and starved. Kneeling in the winter wind with a book, he suffered unspeakably. Despite all this, his lust for Wang Xifeng remained, never imagining she had deliberately tricked him. Two days later, whenever he found a spare moment, he again sought her. Wang Xifeng pretended displeasure, accusing him of failing to show the other night. In desperation, he swore he had come, which in turn let her feign surprise. So she whispered, “This time we’ll do it differently—don’t lurk in that corridor. Wait in the empty room behind my chamber. But be cautious!” “Truly?” Jia Rui asked. “If you doubt me, don’t bother,” Wang Xifeng teased. “Certainly I’ll come—even if it kills me,” he vowed. “All right, away with you.” Jia Rui left, convinced that at last he was sure to succeed. Wang Xifeng then gathered her staff, planning the trap.

Night arrived, Jia Rui surreptitiously headed to the agreed empty room, pacing like an ant on a hot stove. Half an hour, an hour—still no one. He grew apprehensive: “Could she have duped me again? Will I freeze once more?” While he brooded, he heard footsteps in the dark. Concluding it was Wang Xifeng, he leapt forward, grabbing the figure in a fierce embrace: “Sweet Sister-in-law! I’ve waited to death!” He dragged the person onto the kang, kissing and groping, moaning “dear father, dear mother” in a rapture of lust. The other remained mute. Jia Rui yanked off his own trousers, seeking union. Suddenly, a flash of lamplight revealed Jia Qiang holding a candle, illuminating them: “Who’s in here?” And the one in Jia Rui’s arms gave a laugh: “Uncle Rui wants me.” Jia Rui gaped—it was actually Jia Rong. In horror, he jerked upright, but Jia Qiang seized him by the collar: “Not so fast! Sister-in-law has already complained to the Mistress that you harassed her. She’s waiting to have you caught. Her ladyship fainted with anger, sending me to arrest you. Now come with me.” Jia Rui, near collapse, pleaded, “Good cousin! Deny my presence here, and tomorrow I’ll heavily reward you!” Jia Qiang retorted, “Letting you go is simple, but how lavish is your reward? Verbal claims aren’t enough. Write me a contract.” Jia Rui panicked, “How can I write it?” Jia Qiang insisted, “Simply claim you lost a gambling wager for some amount of silver.” Jia Rui sighed, “Fine.” They pretended a quick draft, Jia Rui setting a sum of fifty taels, affixing his seal. Jia Qiang pocketed it, then turned to subdue Jia Rong, who refused, threatening to let the clan know. Jia Rui, desperate, kowtowed and wept. Jia Qiang tricked him: “Stop fussing. Let’s finalize your vow with another note for fifty taels.” The two scrawled that as well. Next, Jia Qiang declared, “If I release you right now, I’ll be blamed as your accomplice. Grandmother’s door is locked, the Master’s in the front hall examining the new shipments from Nanjing. That route’s out of the question. The only exit is the back gate, but if anyone sees us, we’re all in trouble. Let me scout first.” He led Jia Rui out to a courtyard, extinguished the lamp, then pointed to the tall steps, saying, “Hide under here and keep still. I’ll return.” He turned away with Jia Rong and left.

Jia Rui had no choice but to crouch under the marble steps. Moments later, from above came a loud splash: a chamber pot of urine and filth poured over him. He yelped, “Oh, no!” but quickly covered his mouth, not daring a bigger outcry. Drenched in filth, he shook with cold. Soon Jia Qiang returned, shouting, “Quickly, run!” Jia Rui, saved from a dire fix, sprinted out the back gate. Reaching home near third watch, a servant saw him in that state, gasping, “What happened?” Jia Rui lied, “Fell into the latrine in the dark.” He rushed to change clothes and bathe, trembling all over. Even so, his longing for Wang Xifeng only grew stronger, though also overshadowed by fear. Over the next days, Jia Rong and Jia Qiang frequently pressed him for money. He dreaded his grandfather’s discovering this. Tormented by both lust and debt, forced to handle day-to-day lessons, battered by shame, he found no relief. Day by day he lost his appetite, his steps grew shaky, his vision blurred, nights brought fever, days brought fatigue, urination ended in involuntary emission, coughing produced blood. Within a year, all such symptoms converged. He soon became bedridden, raving deliriously, haunted by lurid dreams. They summoned countless doctors who flung all manner of robust prescriptions—cinnamon bark, prepared aconite, turtle shell, and ophiopogon—dozens of pounds of medicine all useless.

When the twelfth month ended and spring returned, his condition rapidly worsened. Jia Dairu grew frantic, hiring more physicians—none availed. In desperation, they tried pure ginseng tonic, but how could Dairu afford it in quantity? He ventured to the Rong Mansion, appealing for help. Lady Wang told Wang Xifeng, “Measure out two taels from what we keep.” Wang Xifeng answered, “But I used up that batch for Grandmother’s prescription and set aside the rest for Mistress Yang the Commandant’s wife, only yesterday I sent it off. We have none.” Lady Wang sighed, “If that’s so, have someone check with your mother-in-law or your elder cousin. Some supply might remain. The poor boy’s life might be saved by a bit of ginseng.” Wang Xifeng simply nodded, sending out a servant with leftover dregs and a handful of scraps, totaling a few qian, instructing them to say, “Lady Wang is giving them all we have.” Then telling Lady Wang, “We scrounged from a few spots and found just over two taels, so it’s been sent.” Jia Rui, desperate for life, accepted any remedy, but still no improvement.

One day, a lame Taoist monk arrived at his door, collecting alms and claiming to cure karmic illnesses. Hearing this inside, Jia Rui cried out that they must invite him in. Sinking onto his pillow, he repeatedly bowed. The family had no choice but to let the Taoist see him. Jia Rui grabbed him, wailing, “Merciful saint, save me!” The Taoist sighed, “Your disease defies normal medicine. I have an object to give you. Gaze upon it daily, and your life might be spared.” He then drew from his sack a mirror, polished on both sides, with the words “Mirror of Love and Lust” engraved on the back. He handed it to Jia Rui. “This treasure hails from the Illusion Hall of the Realm of Great Void, crafted by the Fairy of Disenchantment to cure those led astray by lustful thoughts. Provided you follow my instructions: never look at the front, only at the back. If you heed that, after three days you should recover. Then I’ll retrieve it.” With that, he left, ignoring their pleas.

Jia Rui clutched the mirror, thinking, “Let me test it right away.” He angled the mirror’s backside at his face. There he saw only a tiny skeleton gazing back. Startled, he covered it at once, cursing the Taoist for frightening him. He then turned it to look at the front—and glimpsed Wang Xifeng inside, beckoning him. Overjoyed, he felt as if his soul drifted into the mirror, where he and Wang Xifeng indulged in a tumult of passion. Then she escorted him out. Back on his bed, he groaned, eyes fluttering, the mirror having fallen forward to its backside, again revealing the small skeleton. He realized he was drenched in sweat, with semen spilled. Yet craving more, he flipped it again. Wang Xifeng reappeared, calling him in, and again he succumbed. Three or four times he repeated this, until at last, as she led him out, two men appeared, shackling him with iron chains. Hauling him away, he cried, “Let me first fetch the mirror!” But halfway through that plea, he could no longer speak. His attendants saw him gazing into the mirror, then dropping it, repeating the cycle. Finally, the mirror fell away, and he lay still. Approaching, they found he was gone, drenched from the waist downward with semen. They rushed to carry him. Jia Dairu and the family broke down in tears, cursing the Taoist as a demon. They built a fire to burn the mirror. Suddenly a voice from above cried, “Who told him to gaze at the front side? You yourselves mistook illusions for truth—why burn my mirror?” With that, the mirror soared away. Dairu stepped out, seeing that lame Taoist from earlier, calling, “Return my ‘Mirror of Love and Lust!’” He seized the mirror and vanished.

With no recourse, Dairu handled Jia Rui’s funeral. Notices went out, and a three-day vigil preceded the seventh-day rites, burying him behind the Iron Bar Monastery. The entire Jia clan came to pay respects. From the Rong Mansion, Jia She donated twenty taels, Jia Zheng likewise, and from the Ning Mansion, Jia Zhen contributed twenty, while lesser relations gave from a tael or two up to several. Classmates added another thirty taels or so. Thus, though Dairu was poor, there was enough for a proper funeral.

Then came winter’s end. Lin Ruhai (Daiyu’s father) fell severely ill, writing to request Daiyu’s return to him. Grandmother Jia, worried, decided to let Daiyu go. Baoyu felt most uneasy, but father and child were intimately bound, so he couldn’t object. Grandmother Jia directed Jia Lian to escort Daiyu there and then come back. All the customary gifts for a homeward journey were assembled. They picked a day, and Jia Lian, with Daiyu and various attendants, boarded a boat for Yangzhou.

What happened afterward awaits the next chapter.
CHAPTER 13
Qin Keqing Dies and Is Posthumously Titled a Dragon-Guard Lieutenant;
Wang Xifeng Assumes Management of the Ning Mansion

On this day, Wang Xifeng, ever since Jia Lian had departed with Lin Daiyu for Yangzhou, found herself rather listless. Each evening she would only chat briefly with Ping’er before going to bed. One particular night, she and Ping’er were seated by lamplight near a brazier, having already ordered the bedclothes to be warmed. Once they lay down, they chatted about what leg of the journey Jia Lian and Daiyu might have reached. Before they knew it, the third watch had arrived, and Ping’er had fallen asleep, while Wang Xifeng’s eyes were only then growing drowsy.

In that vague state, she suddenly saw Qin-shi walk in from outside. Smiling, Qin-shi said, “Auntie, how soundly you sleep! I’m leaving for home today, yet you don’t even come to see me off. Because we’ve been so close, I can’t bear to go without saying goodbye, so here I am. There’s one more thing weighing on me, something I must tell you—nobody else might handle it well.”

Wang Xifeng (in her half-dream) asked, “What is it? Just say the word.” Qin-shi replied, “Auntie, you’re the bold champion among women— those men in caps and belts can’t match you. How is it that you don’t understand a simple proverb? People say, ‘When the moon is full, it soon wanes; when water overflows, it spills over,’ and also, ‘The higher one stands, the heavier one falls.’ Right now our family is flourishing, but if one day our merriment brings calamity—fulfilling that phrase ‘when the tree falls, the monkeys scatter’—wouldn’t it mean our centuries of scholarly prestige had been empty after all?”

Wang Xifeng’s spirit grew uneasy; she reverently said, “Indeed, that’s a serious concern. But is there some plan to preserve us from disaster?” Qin-shi gave a faint laugh. “Auntie, you’re too naive. ‘Extremes reverse to their opposites, fortune and misfortune cycle in turn.’ Such is beyond human power to uphold forever. But if, in our present prosperity, we prepare for future decline, we may safeguard ourselves far longer. As things stand, all is in good order, save for two matters. Should we settle those now, then we can ensure future peace.” Wang Xifeng asked, “What are they?” Qin-shi explained, “First, though we have seasonal offerings at the ancestral graves, there’s no permanent funding for them. Second, although there’s a clan school, there’s no consistent endowment. At present, while we flourish, the family doesn’t lack resources for rituals and tuition. But imagine a time of failure, where will the money come from? My thought is that now, while we are wealthy, we purchase farmland and properties around the ancestral burial ground as a permanent revenue for ancestral rites and the school’s expenses. We’d place the clan school there as well, settle a clear system with older and younger relatives, letting each branch administer for a year, bearing the costs from that land. So it circulates in turn, with no reason for conflict or mortgaging. Even if we face trouble, personal property might be seized, but these communal lands for ancestral rites remain untouched by official claims. Suppose future descendants must retreat home to farm and study, they’ll still have a fallback, ensuring the ancestral sacrifices never cease. Yet if we now assume the family’s fortune will never end and fail to plan ahead, we’d regret it too late. Soon there’s a ‘great joy’ about to happen—like adding oil to the fire, or flowers atop brocade. It might prove the pinnacle of grandeur—an ephemeral glory. We mustn’t forget the old saying that ‘the grandest feast will eventually disperse.’ Without prudent preparations, regret awaits.”

Wang Xifeng quickly asked, “What joyous event do you mean?” Qin-shi answered, “Heaven’s secrets can’t be divulged. But since we share a strong bond, let me leave you two parting lines—promise me you’ll remember them.” She then recited:

“When spring’s three months pass, all blossoms fade;
Each must seek a gate of his or her own.”
Wang Xifeng was about to inquire further, but at that moment the watchman in the second courtyard sounded the wooden clapper four times. The sad cadence signified a death in the household. Wang Xifeng woke with a start, drenched in cold sweat. She heard someone reporting, “In the East Mansion, Young Mistress Rong has passed away.” Terrified, Wang Xifeng sprang up from bed. Hastily dressing, she went to Lady Wang. By now, the entire family knew, and all were overwhelmed with dismay. Each felt sorrow: the elders recalling her dutiful conduct; her peers recalling her gentle warmth; the younger ones lamenting her kindness and love; and even the household servants remembering how compassionately she treated the poor and lowly. Everyone wept and wailed in distress.

Turning to Baoyu: since Lin Daiyu had gone home, he’d been lonely, sleeping early each night. Now roused from sleep with the news of Qin-shi’s death, he quickly got up, and a sharp ache in his heart made him spit a mouthful of blood. Alarmed, Xiren and the others hurried to help, wanting to call the old lady’s doctor. Baoyu insisted, “No need—just an outburst of hot anger making my blood run astray.” Dressing quickly, he insisted on going to see Grandmother Jia, pleading to head over at once. Xiren wanted to dissuade him, but couldn’t. Grandmother Jia, upon hearing his plan, argued, “She only just died. That place is unclean, and it’s the middle of the night with harsh winds. Morning would be wiser.” Baoyu refused to wait, so she ordered a carriage readied, increasing the escort to protect him.

They reached the Ning Mansion gate, wide open, torches and lanterns flooding the street with light, the courtyard alive with frantic activity, and from within a tumult of crying like a shaking mountain. Baoyu stepped down, hastened to the mortuary hall, wailed with grief, then found You-shi, who was bedridden with a gastric attack and couldn’t meet him. Then he paid respects to Jia Zhen. By this time, nearly the entire clan had arrived: Jia Dairu, Jia Xiu, Jia Chi, Jia Xiao, Jia Dun, Jia She, Jia Zheng, Jia Cong, Jia Heng, Jia Shen, Jia Qian, Jia Qiong, Jia You, Jia Qiang, Jia Chang, Jia Ling, Jia Yun, Jia Qin, Jia Zhen, Jia Ping, Jia Zao, Jia Jun, Jia Fen, Jia Fang, Jia Lan, Jia Jun (another “Jun”), Jia Zhi… (the text enumerates many clan members) …each one present, mourning. Jia Zhen, tears streaming, lamented to Jia Dairu and the others, “This granddaughter-in-law surpassed my own son tenfold in virtue. And now she extends her legs and leaves us. Does that not foretell the extinction of our main line?” Then he sobbed again. They tried consoling him, “She’s gone; tears can’t revive her. Let’s decide how to handle the funeral.” Jia Zhen exclaimed, “How else but with every resource we have?”

At that moment, Qin Bangye, Qin Zhong, and several of the spouse’s relatives arrived, along with You-shi’s younger sister. Jia Zhen instructed Jia Qiong, Jia Qian, Jia Shen, and Jia Qiang to receive the guests. Then he called for an imperial astronomer to fix the dates. They settled on letting the coffin remain for seven sevens, or forty-nine days, with the funeral announcements to go out three days later. Throughout those forty-nine days, one hundred eight Buddhist monks were to chant the Great Compassion Repentance in the main hall to release the spirit of the newly deceased and any wandering ghosts. Another dais with ninety-nine Taoist priests would be raised in Tianxiang Tower, for a nineteen-day ceremony dissolving karmic grievances. The body would rest in Huifang Garden, where an additional fifty monks and fifty Taoists performed paired rites day and night for seven cycles.

Jia Jing, upon hearing that his eldest granddaughter-in-law had died, barely reacted. Lost in his quest for “immortality,” he refused to soil himself with worldly sorrow. Hence, all decisions remained in Jia Zhen’s hands. Freed to indulge his desire for ostentation, Jia Zhen demanded a coffin from only the finest wood. Several cedar planks were offered, but none satisfied him. By chance, Xue Pan arrived to pay condolences. Hearing Jia Zhen wanted top-quality boards, he said, “We have a set of boards in our lumber store, rumored to come from Iron Mesh Mountain. They never decay if used for a coffin. My late father kept them for Prince Zhongyi’s household, but that plan fell through. They’re sealed up in our store still. If you want them, I’ll have them carried over for a look.” Jia Zhen was delighted. When they arrived, thick at eight inches, with grains like betel-nut, scented like musk, they rang like jade when struck. All marveled at them. Jia Zhen asked, “What’s the price?” Xue Pan laughed, “If you tried to buy them, a thousand taels might not suffice. But for us, treat it as a small favor—just pay some labor cost.” Overjoyed, Jia Zhen thanked him profusely, ordering them sawed and fitted. Jia Zheng cautioned, “This might be beyond an ordinary mortal’s capacity—why not a simpler cedar coffin?” But Jia Zhen refused to listen.

Then they heard how one of Qin-shi’s maids, named Ruizhu, had killed herself by head-butting a pillar upon her mistress’s death. This was deemed extraordinary devotion. The entire clan marveled, and Jia Zhen decided to bury her with the honors of a granddaughter, keeping her coffin in Huifang Garden’s Tower of Ascension, alongside the main coffin. Another young maid called Baozhu, because Qin-shi had no children, formally requested to become her adopted daughter, vowing to serve in the funeral procession. Jia Zhen approved, proclaiming her “Young Miss.” So she, in the manner of an unmarried girl, wept bitterly before the coffin. The entire clan complied with these arrangements, none daring confusion.

Yet Jia Zhen still felt uneasy, for Jia Rong was only a “County Confucian Student.” That official rank looked paltry on funeral banners and limited his rightful privileges. In frustration, Jia Zhen felt discontent, until one day, the fourth after her initial “First Seven,” the Grand Palace Eunuch Dai Quan arrived with official tribute. He soon came in a grand sedan with gongs and guards. Jia Zhen hastened to greet him, offering tea in the Doufeng Pavilion. Jia Zhen seized the opportunity to mention wanting a higher rank for Jia Rong, presumably to impress everyone at the funeral. Dai Quan understood. He said, “Likely for the sake of this funeral display?” Jia Zhen nodded. “Yes indeed—sir, your insight is keen.” Dai Quan smirked, “We’re old friends. As luck has it, a post for the 300-member Dragon-Guard Corps has two vacancies. Yesterday the third brother of the Xiangyang Marquis was petitioning me with 1,500 taels, so I’ve somewhat promised him. That leaves one spot. A certain Feng from Yongxing, wanting it for his son, came to me as well, but I’ve delayed him. Since it’s for your grandson, hurry with a résumé.” Jia Zhen quickly produced a red-paper document reading:

“Jia Rong, a Confucian student from Jiangnan’s Ying Tian Prefecture and Jiangning County, age twenty. Grandson of the late Jia Daihua, once titled General of the First Rank with inheritance, father of Jia Jing (Advanced Scholar of the Bingchen year). Father is the hereditary Third-Rank General Wei Lie, named Jia Zhen.”
Dai Quan read it and handed it to a personal page, instructing, “Deliver this to Minister Zhao, have him issue a note for a Fifth-Rank Dragon-Guard Lieutenant, then fill in the résumé. Tomorrow I’ll fetch the silver to finalize it.” The page complied. As Dai Quan stood to leave, Jia Zhen asked, “Where shall I deliver the silver—to the Board or your residence?” Dai Quan said, “At the Board you’ll pay more. Better send a thousand taels to my place and call it even.” Jia Zhen effusively thanked him and saw him off.

Shortly after, they announced the arrival of the wife of the Loyal and Tranquil Marquis, Lady Shi Ding, bringing her niece Shi Xiangyun. Lady Wang and Lady Xing had only just welcomed them inside. Meanwhile, the marquises of Jinxiang, Chuanning, and Shoushan also sent funeral gifts, each displayed at the coffin. Then those lords themselves arrived, greeted by Jia Zhen in the main hall. Such visits from relatives and friends were beyond count for these forty-nine days. The street in front of the Ning Mansion was a continuous throng of people and white mourning decorations, with official carriages coming and going.

Jia Zhen ordered that the next day Jia Rong dress in formal attire to receive his newly granted rank. The funeral offerings and protocols thus followed the privileges of a Fifth-Rank official. The funeral tablets read “Spirit of the official spouse from the Qin family of the Jia clan, titled Yiren, conferred by imperial decree upon her posthumous husband the Dragon-Guard Lieutenant.” The gate of Huifang Garden opened wide to the street, two rows of drummers and musicians stationed left and right, in black-lacquered garments. Regal sabers and axes were displayed in pairs. Outside were erected two giant red-lacquer boards, each gilded with the words “Protector of the Inner Court and Imperial Dragon-Guard Lieutenant.” Opposite rose an ornate platform flanked by Buddhist and Taoist altars. The banners read, “In memory of the Qin family’s Yiren, married into the Jia clan, the protective Dragon-Guard Lieutenant for the front gates. A grand water-and-land ritual of forty-nine days, with the unified prayers of the Four Continents under Heaven, is hereby performed by the Great Compassionate Buddhist monks and Perfected Taoist priests in the Tianshang Building, supervised by the government’s registry of monastic orders….” (the full content was endless).

Though Jia Zhen found satisfaction in all these grand rites, inside the mansion, Mistress You had fallen ill herself, too infirm to oversee details. She worried about the comings and goings of so many titled ladies, lest the slightest breach of etiquette bring ridicule. So she felt great anxiety. Jia Zhen himself worried, feeling unwell, mourning deeply, lacking a capable manager. He spotted Baoyu nearby and confided, “Everything is lavishly arranged, so why do I still fret?” Baoyu responded with a smile, “The reason, I suspect, is you’ve nobody to handle internal matters, since Sister-in-law is ill. I can recommend one person who’s absolutely competent.” Jia Zhen asked, “Who?” But many guests were present, so Baoyu merely leaned in and whispered. Jia Zhen’s face lit up, “Perfect indeed. Let’s go.” He took Baoyu, exiting to the women’s quarters.

It happened not to be a key day, so fewer guests were inside: just a few close female relatives—Lady Xing, Lady Wang, Wang Xifeng, and some clan women. Hearing the steward announce, “Master is entering,” the maids all scattered in alarm. Wang Xifeng alone calmly rose, standing. Jia Zhen, afflicted physically and mentally, leaned on a cane as he stepped in. Lady Xing and Lady Wang admonished, “You’re ill, weighed down with grief, yet still wandering in. Why not rest? What is it?” Jia Zhen tried bowing to them, but they pressed him to sit. He refused, forcing a smile. “Nephew humbly requests two aunts and dear Sister to grant me a favor.” Lady Xing asked, “What is it?” Jia Zhen replied, “You aunts must be aware that the grandson’s wife has died, and the nephew’s wife is also unwell. The inner household is in disarray. If dear Sister [he indicates Wang Xifeng] could manage it for a month, my mind would be at ease.” Lady Xing observed, “Oh, so that’s your intention. Well, your younger sister-in-law belongs to your second aunt’s household, so you can ask her.” Lady Wang, hearing, said, “But she’s young. She’s never run a funeral from inside—what if something is overlooked and people laugh at us? Maybe find someone else.” Jia Zhen insisted, “We know Sister is extremely capable and was already adept in household business even as a girl. Now she’s in your home, a proven manager, more cunning and seasoned. Over the past days, I can think of no one else. Aunt, if not for my wife’s memory, at least for the deceased’s sake, do me this kindness.” Then tears welled in his eyes.

Lady Wang, worried that Xifeng was inexperienced in funeral protocols, hesitated. Meanwhile, Wang Xifeng, who loved to take charge, recognized Jia Zhen’s sincere plea. She looked to Lady Wang: “Since he’s so earnest, you might let me try.” Lady Wang quietly asked, “Can you manage it?” Wang Xifeng said, “Certainly. The major issues outside are already set by him. Inside details I can handle. If anything’s unfamiliar, I’ll ask you, Aunt. It’ll be fine.” Swayed, Lady Wang fell silent. Jia Zhen, thrilled, exclaimed, “Then I’m truly indebted. Let me bow first to Sister.” He moved to salute her. Wang Xifeng hastened to return the salute.

Next, Jia Zhen commanded someone to fetch the Ning Mansion’s official token, handing it to Baoyu so he could present it to Wang Xifeng. “Little Sister, do as you see fit. If something’s needed, show them this. Don’t worry about me—use as much as you want. Also, treat people with generosity rather than pinching pennies, so we’re not slandered. That’s all I ask.” Wang Xifeng hesitated, glancing at Lady Wang. Baoyu forced the token into her hands. Jia Zhen asked, “Should Sister move here, or come daily? Coming daily might tire you. Let me arrange rooms for you.” Wang Xifeng smiled, “No need. My household can’t spare me so thoroughly. I’ll just come daily.” Jia Zhen nodded, “That’s acceptable.” After a bit more discussion, he left.

The ladies eventually dispersed. Lady Wang then asked Wang Xifeng, “So how will you proceed?” Wang Xifeng replied, “Madam, you return first. I need to plan a workable system.” Lady Wang and Lady Xing left. Wang Xifeng, taking a seat in a small side house, pondered. “First, the estate is overstaffed—things go missing. Second, no designated leaders, so tasks are disorganized. Third, the finances are uncontrolled, allowing for embezzlement. Fourth, big or small chores get assigned unevenly, leading to discontent. Fifth, certain big personalities roam unrestrained; the well-born won’t obey discipline, and the lower ones can’t be promoted. These five remain the entrenched ways of the Ning Mansion.”

How will Wang Xifeng handle it? The next chapter will reveal.
Chapter 14

Lin Ruhai’s Spirit Returns to Suzhou;
On His Journey, Jia Baoyu Encounters the Prince of Beijing

At the Ning Mansion, the general steward Lai Sheng heard that Wang Xifeng from the Rong Mansion had been invited to supervise internal matters. He gathered his fellow stewards, saying, “They’ve asked Second Mistress Lian to manage the household affairs here. If she needs items from the storehouse or gives orders, be diligent. Arrive early and leave late every day for this next month. Let’s not disgrace ourselves. She’s famously strict—sharp-tongued and hard-hearted. If we anger her, she’ll show no mercy.” Everyone responded, “Agreed.” One person laughed, “Frankly, the estate inside needs her iron hand. It’s grown far too disorderly.” Just as they spoke, they saw Laiwang’s wife approach with the official Ning Mansion token to claim certain documents and forms, with a note listing what she needed. All promptly brought her tea and instructed others to gather the paper. Laiwang’s wife carried it off.

Wang Xifeng immediately ordered Caiming to prepare the record books, then summoned Lai Sheng’s wife to review the household name registers. She decreed that the next morning at dawn, all the household women should gather for instructions. She briefly checked the supply lists and asked Lai Sheng’s wife a few questions, then left for home. The next day, precisely at the first quarter of the Mao hour (about 5:30-6:00 a.m.), she arrived at the Ning Mansion. All the older maids and wives had been waiting in the courtyard. Watching from outside the window, they heard Wang Xifeng say to Lai Sheng’s wife, “Since they’ve entrusted me, I’ll have to risk your displeasure. I’m not as lenient as your mistress—I won’t tolerate any trifling nonsense. Don’t tell me ‘this is how it’s always been here.’ From now on, things go my way. If anyone disobeys, I don’t care whether they’re high or low; I’ll punish them all the same.” Finishing, she had Caiming call out names from the register, each woman entering one by one so Xifeng could look them over.

When she was done, she gave orders: “These twenty women, split into two shifts of ten, shall handle greeting and serving tea to visiting friends. Nothing else. Another twenty, also in two shifts, handle food and drink for relatives—also nothing else. Another forty stand by the coffin and altars, lighting incense, oiling lamps, hanging drapery, attending the vigil and funeral offerings—nothing else. Next, these four staff the inner tea room, collecting and storing cups, bowls, and teapots; if anything goes missing, they share the penalty. Another four manage wine sets and dinnerware; if anything disappears, they pay for it. Another eight handle receiving funeral gifts. Another eight oversee all lamps, candles, and spirit money that I allot to you; you, in turn, distribute it as I direct. Another twenty must guard the doors at night, watching for fire hazards and cleaning. Whoever’s left will be assigned to specific rooms— each in charge of that room’s tables, chairs, curios, even the smallest spittoon or feather duster. If anything’s lost or damaged, that caretaker pays. Lai Sheng’s wife will supervise daily. If you catch someone gambling, brawling, or otherwise idling, report them. If you shield them and I find out, you’ll disgrace yourself after all these decades. With each task designated, if something goes wrong in that area, I’ll hold that group responsible.

“In the Rong Mansion, the staff around me all carry timepieces. Everything happens at set hours. You have a large clock in your main hall. I’ll arrive at the first quarter of Mao (dawn) to check attendance. At mid-morning, you can take your breakfast. Any official errands or requests for supplies must wait until midday. At dusk, we burn incense for the departed. I’ll personally inspect each area, then lock the doors. The next morning at dawn, the cycle repeats. We’ll all endure a month of this, then you’ll be free again. Once the rites are over, your master will surely reward you.”

She also instructed them to distribute as needed the tea leaves, candles, feather dusters, brooms, etc. Meanwhile, furniture—tables, seats, cushions, mats, spittoons, footstools—were issued with precise notes of who took what. Each person left with a clear assignment, unlike before, when everyone vied for the easy tasks, leaving difficult ones unclaimed. Nor could anything vanish unaccountably, and even arrivals of guests lodging in the mansion proceeded in good order, unlike the earlier chaos, theft, and confusion.

Wang Xifeng’s authority and efficiency soon took full effect, and she secretly felt quite pleased with herself. Observing that Mistress You lay ill and that Jia Zhen, overcome by grief, ate little, she daily prepared refined porridges and delicate dishes, sending them over from the mansion’s kitchen. Jia Zhen reciprocated, ordering premium fare delivered to her side kiosk each day. Xifeng showed no fear of hard work, arriving each day at set times to check attendance, then withdrawing alone to that kiosk. She did not mingle with the other ladies; if any female relatives arrived, she took no special part in greeting them.

On this day, which was the fifth day of the fifth seven-day cycle of mourning (the “Five-Seven Rite”), the monks were engaged in “Breaking the Hells” through ceremonial chanting, petitioning the King of Hell, summoning Kṣitigarbha, erecting a Golden Bridge, etc. Meanwhile, Taoists were offering up memorial tablets to the Three Pure Ones, praying to the Jade Emperor. The devout monks burned incense, set up a “Rice-Offering,” performed Water Repentance; and there were a dozen young nuns wearing embroidered robes and red shoes, chanting mantras for the deceased before the coffin, creating quite a spectacle. Wang Xifeng knew that day would bring many guests, so at the second watch of night she arose for her ablutions. By the time she’d dressed, sipped some milk, and rinsed her mouth, the appointed early hour had arrived. Laiwang’s wife and others had long awaited her. She boarded her carriage from the front hall, escorted by a pair of bright horn lanterns labeled “Rong Mansion.”

Arriving at the Ning Mansion gates, she saw large hanging lanterns, and a row of servants in white mourning clothes lined up silently as if it were midday. At the main entrance, a group of older maids lifted her carriage drapery. Wang Xifeng stepped down with the support of her maid Feng’er, two wives bearing lamps on each side. The Ning Mansion wives greeted her with curtsies. Entering the Huifang Garden and ascending the Tower of Immortals (Dengxian Ge) where the coffin lay, she spotted the great coffin and burst into tears like beads scattering. In the courtyard, the young servants—tasked with lighting paper money—instantly joined in with loud weeping. Jia Zhen and Mistress You had them attempt to soothe Xifeng; eventually she subdued her sobs. She rinsed her mouth with tea, then headed to the kiosk to carry out her daily roll call. Summoning the staff, she found everyone present except one of the greeters for visiting relatives. She said, “So it’s you who’s late. You must think you have more standing than others and can ignore my orders!” The woman begged forgiveness, “I come daily on time except today—I beg your mercy.” Even as she pleaded, a woman from the Rong Mansion named Wang Xing’s wife poked her head in.

Wang Xifeng turned her attention: “What do you need?” Wang Xing’s wife answered, “I’m here for your authorization to collect thread for weaving carriage hoods.” She handed over a slip listing two large sedans, four small chairs, four carts, and how many threads were needed. Wang Xifeng had Caiming record it, then sign out the Rong Mansion’s token to her. She departed. Moments later, four more from the Rong Mansion arrived to request supplies, showing their slips. After checking, Wang Xifeng found two items incorrectly itemized, tossed the notes aside, and told them to recheck. They left. Then Zhangcai’s wife approached, presenting her slip for compensation to the seamstresses. Wang Xifeng took it, registering it under “wait until Wang Xing’s wife’s transaction is done,” then asked Zhangcai’s wife to retrieve it after cross-checking.

Turning back to the tardy woman, she continued, “If I were lenient, next time I’d have no authority. Better to make an example.” Her expression hardened: “Take her out and give her twenty strokes!” Frightened, no one dared intervene. The punishment was administered, and they reported back. Wang Xifeng threw down the Ning Mansion token. “Inform Lai Sheng to dock her monthly pay. That’s all—dismissed.” Trembling, the rest hurried to their tasks, and the beaten woman crept away in shame. From then on, people fully recognized her severity, each operating diligently.

Around this time, Baoyu—fearing Qin Zhong might be mistreated—arrived with him to watch Wang Xifeng. She happened to be eating. On seeing them, she laughed, “You’re swift on your feet, come join me.” Baoyu demurred, “We already ate with Grandmother or at home. Please, you go ahead.” Finishing her meal, a maid from the Ning Mansion arrived for a supply request. Xifeng teased, “I half expected you. If you’d forgotten, that would only profit me.” The maid smiled, “Indeed, I nearly forgot. If I’d been a bit later, I might have missed you.” She left with the slip. Then four men from the Rong Mansion came for some transaction, but Xifeng found two lines incorrect and rejected them. They left in dismay. Qin Zhong commented, “Both mansions use these tokens. What if someone forged one and used it to claim silver or goods?” Wang Xifeng retorted, “You think we have no oversight? We do!” Baoyu asked, “Why isn’t anyone from our side requesting items now?” She replied, “They come early, while you’re still asleep. Let me ask: when does your night class begin?” Baoyu answered, “I can’t wait for it to start—if only they’d finish repairs to the study.” Wang Xifeng teased, “I can hurry them, if you like.” Baoyu teased back, “It’ll happen eventually.” Xifeng quipped, “They need supplies—I hold the token. No one can get anything unless I sign.” Baoyu pestered, “You see, good sister, give them the token so they can fetch those materials!” She laughed, “My bones ache, yet you’re yanking at me? Don’t fret. They took paper for pasting up the study earlier. They’ll come for more when needed.” Disbelieving, Baoyu pressed, so Wang Xifeng called Caiming to show the ledger.

Just then a messenger arrived from Suzhou named Zhao’er. He was summoned inside. Bowing, he explained, “Second Master sent me back. Lord Lin died at the hour of Sishi on the third day of the ninth month. Master Lian assisted Miss Lin in conveying Lord Lin’s coffin to Suzhou. Likely he’ll return by year’s end. Master Lian sent me to deliver the news and ask for instructions, also to fetch warmer clothing for the trip.” Wang Xifeng asked, “Have you reported this to others?” Zhao’er nodded, “Yes, I’ve met them all.” He left. Xifeng turned to Baoyu with a faint smile, “So your Cousin Lin stays with us no longer.” Baoyu moaned, “How dreadful. I can’t imagine how much she has wept these days!” He sank into a sigh.

After Zhao’er’s return, Wang Xifeng, in the presence of so many, could not inquire at length about Jia Lian. She grew anxious. That evening, at last, she summoned Zhao’er for a private talk, learning they’d had a safe journey. She spent the night packing furs and thick garments, personally checking them with Ping’er. She also reflected on other possible needs, bundling them up for Zhao’er. She cautioned him, “Take great care serving Master Lian. Urge him to drink less, and don’t let him mix with unsavory women. If I find out you’ve let that happen, I’ll break your legs!” Zhao’er promised to comply. By the fourth watch, Wang Xifeng slept. At dawn, she rose again to hurry back to the Ning Mansion.

Meanwhile, Jia Zhen saw that the funeral day drew near. He personally took some astrologers from the Divination Office out to Tiekan Monastery to see where the coffin would be temporarily placed. Once there, he instructed Abbot Sekong to prepare more lodging and skilled monks for receiving the funeral. Sekong set a vegetarian banquet, but Jia Zhen was too troubled for a proper meal. Night fell before he could return to the city, so he stayed in the temple’s lodging. Next morning, he hurried home to arrange the burial.

Wang Xifeng, aware the procession was imminent, divided tasks in detail, also dispatching men from the Rong Mansion to accompany Lady Wang for the ceremony. Overladen with responsibilities—especially since the Xi’an Prince’s concubine had also died and needed mourning, and the Western Peace Princess was celebrating a birthday, requiring gifts—plus her maternal brother Wang Ren was heading south with his family, needing to handle the letters and parcels. To top it off, Yingchun was ill, requiring daily doctor visits and medication. Swamped by so much, Wang Xifeng barely had time for meals or rest, commuting between the two mansions. Yet, driven by her innate pride—eager to avoid any slip—she managed everything immaculately, prompting universal admiration from the clan.

On the evening before the final vigil, crowds of relatives and guests filled every chamber. Mistress You remained bedridden, so entertaining fell solely on Wang Xifeng. Although there were many sisters-in-law in the clan, some were clumsy in speech, some frivolous, some timid. Others feared offending. Wang Xifeng alone shone, her graceful composure wowing everyone—like “a single red flower amid a sea of green.” She directed matters with flair, heedless of others. The entire night was ablaze with torches, music echoing, officials coming and going—an outpouring of bustle. By dawn, the auspicious hour arrived, and they carried the coffin out with sixty-four pallbearers. The funeral banner read in bold letters: “Posthumous spirit of Lady Qin from the Jia clan, spouse of the honored Protector of the Inner Court, Dragon-Guard Lieutenant who served by imperial decree.” All the new paraphernalia, hurriedly produced, glistened. The adoptive daughter Baozhu, performing a maiden’s funeral rites, wailed inconsolably while placing the coffin upon the hearse.

Prominent officials joined the procession: Duke Niu Jizong, grandson of Duke Niu Qing who once held the rank of First Class; Duke Liu Fang, descendant of the Liuguo Duke; the grandsons of Marquises Qiguo, Chenguo, Shou Mountain, and so on. We omit details. On the women’s side, around ten large sedans and thirty or forty smaller ones, plus over a hundred carriages, lines of attendants stretching for miles. Halfway along, they encountered a series of grand roadside altars. The first was from the Eastern Peace Prince, the second from the Southern Peace Prince, the third from the Western Peace Prince, and the fourth from the Northern Tranquility Prince. Initially, these four princely houses all derived from the old reign’s favored lineage, though the Northern Tranquility Prince overshadowed the rest. The present heir, Prince Shiron, was still under twenty, renowned for his attractive features and gentle disposition. Upon learning of the Ning Mansion’s bereavement, remembering the old friendship between their families, he took no airs as a prince, offering condolences and setting up a ceremonial station along the route. He had official duties at dawn, then changed into a mourning robe, riding in his official sedan with gongs clearing the way.

Soon, the imposing funeral procession—silver mountain, vast crowds—moved northward. A messenger hurried to inform Jia Zhen, who signaled the procession to halt. Jia Zhen, along with Jia She and Jia Zheng, rushed forward to greet the prince in the name of national protocol. The prince remained in his sedan but bowed courteously, calling them old family friends. Jia Zhen said, “We are deeply honored, yet undeserving of Your Highness’s gracious courtesy.” The prince, smiling, responded, “Between old friends, no such formality.” He then directed his official staff to proceed with the libations. Jia She and Jia Zheng, stepping aside, expressed gratitude. The prince was modest as ever. He inquired of Jia Zheng, “Which one is the youth born with the jade in his mouth? I’ve long hoped to meet him. He must be here—why not present him?” Jia Zheng promptly summoned Baoyu to change attire and come forward.

Baoyu, having heard much of the Northern Tranquility Prince’s virtue, talent, and charm—unencumbered by aristocratic pretensions—had yearned for an introduction, but was always constrained by his father’s vigilance. Now, hearing that the prince himself wished to see him, Baoyu felt both excitement and a certain apprehension. Approaching, he glimpsed Prince Shiron sitting in his sedan, a figure of striking grace.

How they greet each other and what ensues shall appear in the next chapter.
CHAPTER 15
Wang Xifeng Wields Authority at the Iron Threshold Monastery;
Qin Whale-Youth Gains Pleasure at Mantou Nunnery

When Baoyu looked up, he saw the Northern Tranquility Prince Shiron. He wore a pristine white crown with silver wings and a plume, a robe of white brocade embroidered with ocean waves and five-clawed dragons, and a belt of red jade. His face shone like precious jade, and his eyes glowed like bright stars—a truly magnificent, graceful figure. Baoyu hastened forward to greet him. From inside the sedan chair, Shiron extended a hand to help him up. Observing Baoyu’s silver coronet binding his hair, the double-dragon crest on his brow, his white silk arrow-sleeve robe with a silver sash set with pearls, a face like spring blossoms, eyes dark as lacquer, the prince smiled and said, “Your fame is not exaggerated—indeed, you are as ‘Precious’ as you are ‘Jade.’ Where is that treasured stone you bear?”

Baoyu, hearing his question, quickly produced it from within his clothing and handed it over for inspection. Shiron studied it closely, reading aloud the inscriptions. “Has it proven efficacious?” he asked. Jia Zheng stepped forward to answer, “We’ve heard so but have never tested it.” The prince praised its marvel, then tidied the jeweled tassel himself and personally helped Baoyu retie the cord around his neck. Holding Baoyu’s hand, he inquired his age and current studies. Baoyu replied clearly, in a crisp voice with well-formed answers.

Impressed by his speech, Shiron said to Jia Zheng with a laugh, “Your son is indeed an exceptional talent. Even this junior prince can see that he’s no ordinary boy. In future, like a young phoenix outsinging the old, who can guess how far he’ll go?” Jia Zheng offered a deferential smile. “My unworthy child dares not claim the honor of Your Highness’s praise. If Heaven grants him success, it is our family’s good fortune.” Shiron continued, “A small caution: such a gifted youth is surely doted on by his grandmother. But overindulgence can hamper his schooling. My own experience was like that, so if it becomes too difficult for him to concentrate at home, I welcome him to my humble estate. Though I myself lack great ability, I am fortunate to gather famed scholars from across the empire. Were he to visit and join in discussions, his learning would progress daily.” Jia Zheng, bowing, said, “Yes, indeed,”

The prince then took a string of scented prayer beads from his wrist. “Our meeting is sudden, and I have no proper gift to offer. Here is a string of Ling-aroma prayer beads, bestowed by the Emperor himself. Let this serve as a small token of congratulations.” Baoyu hastily received them and turned to offer them to Jia Zheng. Jia Zheng and Baoyu together expressed their thanks. Presently, Jia She and Jia Zhen came forward, requesting the prince to continue on. But the Northern Tranquility Prince demurred, “One newly departed for the celestial realm is no longer of our mundane dust. Though I hold a princely title from the court’s grace, how can I surpass those who have transcended? I’ll withdraw here.” Jia She and the others urged him otherwise, yet he firmly refused. They had to concede, thanking him again as they directed their retinue to halt the music and let the funeral procession pass, while the prince’s own entourage waited quietly.

The Ning Mansion’s funeral was quite a spectacle. Reaching the city gate, they encountered additional marquee pavilions from Jia She’s peers, each offering road-side ceremonies. Finishing those rites, they exited the city and took the wide road to Iron Threshold Monastery. Jia Zhen, accompanied by Jia Rong, hurried among the older generation to allocate carriages and horses. Jia She’s cohort boarded their sedans, Jia Zhen’s group prepared to mount. Meanwhile, Wang Xifeng feared for Baoyu’s safety in the open countryside, lest he roam unruly and ignore the attendants, especially since Jia Zheng might not control him. So she sent a page to call him. Baoyu approached her carriage; Xifeng smiled, “Good brother, you’re a precious one, delicate as a girl. Don’t be racing around on horseback—join me in the carriage, yes?” Baoyu cheerfully complied, dismounting to climb in with her. They laughed and chatted as their vehicle advanced.

Before long, two riders approached from the vanguard, dismounting to inform her, “We’ve come to a good rest spot if Madame wishes to pause and change clothes.” Xifeng asked the older ladies for their preference. They replied, “We won’t bother. Let Sister do as she pleases.” So Xifeng decided to stop. The attendants drove the carriage away from the main group, heading north to a village. Baoyu at once sent a servant to fetch Qin Zhong, who was riding with his father’s sedan. On seeing Baoyu’s own mount following Xifeng’s carriage off north, Qin Zhong guessed Baoyu had joined her, so he spurred his horse to catch up, all going together into a farmstead.

This was but a humble house with few rooms, and the presence of ladies inside posed an inconvenience. The farm women, seeing Wang Xifeng, Baoyu, and Qin Zhong in their splendid attire and striking appearances, stood in awe as if immortals had descended. Xifeng entered a thatched chamber, sending Baoyu and Qin Zhong outside to wander. Baoyu found the farm tools and surroundings fascinating, everything wholly new to him—he’d never seen such implements. Some footmen recognized them and explained each item’s name and function. Hearing how peasants toiled for every grain, Baoyu quoted, “Who knows the meal on one’s plate? Each morsel is hard-won.”

Curious, he stepped into another room. On a kang bed lay a small spinning wheel. Never having witnessed one, he asked, “What is this device?” A servant said, “For spinning yarn.” Baoyu hopped onto the kang to try it. A village girl of about seventeen or eighteen rushed in and blurted, “Don’t break it!” The footmen barked at her, but Baoyu answered kindly, “I didn’t mean harm, I’ve just never seen it, so I wanted to try.” “Then watch me show you,” she replied. Qin Zhong tugged Baoyu’s sleeve and whispered, “She’s quite appealing,” but Baoyu snapped, “Say that again, I’ll smack you!” Meanwhile, the girl demonstrated, spinning the wheel deftly. Just then an older woman called from outside, “Second Girl, come here!” So she put down the wheel and hurried off. Baoyu gazed after her with mild regret. Soon, Xifeng’s maid summoned them back inside. Xifeng had rinsed her hands and changed clothes, asking if Baoyu also wished to change. He declined. When they’d all taken some snacks and tea, the farm family was given a tip from the steward. Baoyu looked around hoping to glimpse the spinning girl, but she did not appear. Walking out of the yard, they spotted her at the edge of the village, holding a small child with two younger kids, staring at them. Baoyu cast her a lingering glance as the carriage rolled away, swiftly out of sight.

They joked and talked until catching up with the main procession, where in front, monks were clashing cymbals and drums, banners fluttered, and the Iron Threshold Monastery’s priests lined the roadside. Soon they arrived at the monastery. Another wave of funerary rites ensued, a new incense altar and arrangement. They placed the coffin in an adjacent hall, with Baozhu taking up her vow to remain as companion. Outside, Jia Zhen hosted refreshments for the myriad relatives, some staying, some leaving. All left by midday or so. Among the women, Wang Xifeng had received them in the inner quarters, dismissing them similarly. Only a few close kin lingered for the three-day service. Lady Xing and Lady Wang, seeing that Xifeng would be forced to remain, took Baoyu to return to the city. But Baoyu, enthralled by the countryside, refused to go, nor did Qin Zhong want to leave, so both appealed to Wang Xifeng. She considered her tasks. Most major funeral business was concluded, but a few finishing touches remained. She also had wanted to settle a separate matter for the old nun at Mantou Nunnery, and Baoyu’s repeated pleas softened her. She said to him, “All right, we’ll endure one more day; tomorrow we truly must leave.” Delighted, Baoyu promised to depart the next day.

Wang Xifeng then discreetly summoned her steward, Wang’er, to relay instructions. Wang’er left for the city to coordinate with a particular yamen secretary, forging a letter in Jia Lian’s name and sending it overnight to Chang’an County a hundred miles away. In only two days all was settled. The local official Yun Guang, an old friend of the Jias, easily complied. He forwarded a response, and Wang’er returned.

Meanwhile, that evening, Xifeng, Baoyu, and Qin Zhong stayed once more at Mantou Nunnery rather than at the monastery, as it was more convenient. The nunnery, allied with Water Moon Temple, earned its nickname from the tasty steamed buns they made. It was located near Iron Threshold Monastery. The old abbess, Jingxu, together with her two disciples, Zhishan and Zhinen, welcomed them warmly. After washing up, Xifeng commented that Zhinen had grown taller and prettier since last time. The old abbess explained, “We’ve been busy chanting scripture for a wealthy family who just had a baby boy, so we didn’t visit. We hoped to see you, but we were detained.”

While Xifeng talked with the abbess, Baoyu and Qin Zhong roamed the temple. Spotting Zhinen, Baoyu teased, “Here comes ‘Neng.’” Qin Zhong retorted, “Why pay her any mind?” Baoyu laughed, “Don’t pretend. Weren’t you hugging her that day in Grandmother’s rooms when no one else was around?” Qin Zhong insisted it never happened, but Baoyu threatened, “Argue all you want, I’ll expose you.” So Qin Zhong gave in, “Fine, brother. Let’s not argue.” Baoyu demanded, “Then call her to bring me some tea.” Qin Zhong demurred, “You call her. She’ll bring it.” Baoyu said, “But then it’s a routine serving. If you call, it’s full of feeling.” Helpless, Qin Zhong said, “Neng, bring tea, please.” Zhinen, long acquainted with them from visits, often joked around. She fetched tea, and Qin Zhong pretended to give it to Baoyu, while Baoyu tried to grab it first. Zhinen laughed, “Are you two fighting over a cup of tea? Do you think my hand is dripping with honey?” Baoyu took it and was about to speak more, but Zhishan called Zhinen away to help with serving fruit. Then others arrived to invite them for refreshments. They had no appetite, so simply sat for a bit, then wandered off again.

Xifeng retired to a small side room, the old abbess keeping her company. The maids and older women, seeing no major tasks, quietly withdrew. Taking advantage, the abbess spoke up: “There’s a matter I’ve been meaning to beg of your mansion. I hope, Mistress, you might raise it with My Lady.” Xifeng asked, “What is it?” Jingxu explained, “Amitabha! I used to live at Shancai Nunnery in Chang’an County, where a wealthy man named Zhang often brought offerings. He has a daughter called Jin’er, who one day came to light incense. She was spotted by the county magistrate’s brother-in-law, Li. He fell for her at first sight and soon proposed marriage. However, Jin’er was already betrothed to the ex-Garrison Commander’s son. Zhang is caught between them—he can’t simply break the earlier engagement, or the Commander’s family might protest. But Li insists on marrying her, claiming the engagement is void. Now the Commander’s side is outraged, charging them in court: ‘How can one girl be promised to two families?’ So the Zhang family is panicking, wanting to use connections. I thought: the Chang’an Commandery’s official, Mr. Yun, is a friend of your household. Perhaps Lady Wang or your masters might send a letter, asking him to speak to the Commander. Then he’d have to yield. If that works out, Zhang is willing to spend whatever it takes in gratitude.”

Wang Xifeng responded with a laugh, “That’s not too big a matter. But My Lady rarely involves herself in such affairs.” “Then you could do it,” the old abbess persisted. “I have no shortage of money for you.” Xifeng shrugged, “I’m not short of spending money. Why should I trouble myself for bribes? No, I want no part of it.” Jingxu sighed, “Then Zhang’s folk will say you lack the influence to settle even a trivial matter.” Stirred by this challenge, Wang Xifeng answered, “If I want something done, I’ll do it. I’m just too busy now. If they can produce three thousand taels, I’ll see it through. That doesn’t mean I’m greedy—it’s for the men we dispatch to handle the lobbying, so they can earn their keep. I personally won’t keep a penny. If I wanted money, I have more than enough already.” The old abbess exulted, “That sum is quite feasible. Then might you kindly intervene soon?” Xifeng said, “Look how busy I am. But since I’ve said yes, rest assured I’ll see to it.” The nun flattered her, “No one else could do it so swiftly or skillfully. They say ‘the more capable, the more they accomplish.’ You must also take care of your health.” Thus they conversed pleasantly.

Meanwhile, Qin Zhong slipped off in the dark, searching for Zhinen. Entering a rear room, he found her alone washing teacups. He clasped her in his arms for a kiss. Alarmed, she tried to break free, anxious not to cause a fuss. Qin Zhong begged, “If you deny me, I’ll die right here. Let us be close!” She objected, “Not possible in this place. Wait until I leave this cage.” Qin Zhong insisted, “That’s a future plan. Meanwhile, how do we satisfy this immediate longing?” Blowing out the lamp, he hauled her onto the kang. She struggled quietly, unwilling to shout, but he soon loosened her under-robe. At that moment, a shadow leaned in behind him, pinning him down without a word. They nearly died of fright, only to hear a snicker. Realizing it was Baoyu, Qin Zhong jumped up: “What’s this?” Baoyu teased, “You protest? I could raise a hue and cry.” Startled, Zhinen scrambled away in the darkness. Baoyu tugged Qin Zhong outside and teased, “Still want to deny it? If you hush up, I’ll let it pass.” Qin Zhong chuckled, “Anything you want, dear brother, just don’t speak of this.” Baoyu said, “We’ll see how it goes once we’re in bed.”

When it was time to rest, Xifeng took the inner chamber, Baoyu and Qin Zhong the outer, with maids and old women sprawled about the floor on watch. Xifeng, worried about Baoyu’s “Precious Jade,” took it from him once he slept and placed it by her pillow. As for how Baoyu dealt with Qin Zhong that night, none can say. The text is unclear, so we dare not fabricate.

By dawn, word came from the Rong Mansion that Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang had sent more clothes for Baoyu, instructing him to return home if he had no pressing business. Yet Baoyu was unwilling, and Qin Zhong also wished to linger near Zhinen, so they persuaded Xifeng to remain one more day. Xifeng, reflecting that a few minor tasks remained, that it would please Jia Zhen further, and that it satisfied Baoyu, conceded. She told him, “We must definitely go tomorrow, though.” Baoyu thanked her effusively.

That evening, she quietly relayed the old nun’s request to Laiwang. He rushed back to the city, visited a certain official scribe, forging a letter under Jia Lian’s name, and sent it that very night a short distance to Chang’an. Within two days, they gained the favorable reply. The local commander Yun Guang, indebted to the Jias, had easily agreed. Wang’er returned with the success.

Wang Xifeng and party thus spent another day. On the next morning, she took leave of the old abbess, instructing that after three more days, the nun should visit the mansion for final instructions. Qin Zhong and Zhinen parted reluctantly, forging various secret pledges before departing in sorrow. Xifeng returned to Iron Threshold Monastery, made certain all was well, and saw that Baozhu remained steadfast in her vigil, so Jia Zhen assigned women to accompany her.

But details afterward must wait. Let us follow what unfolds in the next chapter.
CHAPTER 16

Lin Ruhai’s Spirit Returns to Suzhou;
Jia Baoyu Crosses Paths with the Northern Tranquility Prince

Qin Zhong and Baoyu had followed Wang Xifeng, tending to matters at Iron Threshold Monastery. Having finished their oversight, they rode back to the city in her carriage. Once home, they reported to Grandmother Jia, Lady Wang, and the rest, then retired to their rooms for the night without further incident.

The next morning, Baoyu learned that his outer study had been prepared, and he had arranged with Qin Zhong to study there in the evenings. Unfortunately, Qin Zhong—frail by nature—had caught a chill in the open countryside; in addition, he and Zhinen had secretly met several times, which further weakened him. On returning home, he coughed and lost his appetite, sinking into a worrying state. Confined to bed, he had to suspend their plan. Baoyu, disappointed but with no alternative, waited for Qin Zhong to recover before resuming their lessons.

Meanwhile, Wang Xifeng received a letter from Yun Guang indicating that all had been settled with the matter involving the old nun. She had given instructions; the Zhang family’s official dispute concluded with the commander forced to accept the prior engagement’s nullification. Yet ironically, that daughter Jin-Ge, hearing her parents had broken one engagement for another, felt only distress. She took her own life with a silk cord. The commander’s son, himself a devoted soul, upon learning of her suicide, drowned himself in the river. Thus, both sides suffered “losing money and losing lives,” while Wang Xifeng quietly pocketed three thousand taels of silver. Lady Wang, of course, knew nothing about it. So Xifeng’s nerve only strengthened, and from then on she would carry out similar ventures repeatedly.

One day, it happened to be Jia Zheng’s birthday. All members of both the Ning and Rong mansions gathered in celebration, with great fanfare. In the midst of the revelry, a gate officer rushed in to report, “The chief eunuch, Lord Xia, has arrived on imperial orders!” Startled, Jia She, Jia Zheng, and the others halted the entertainment, removed the feast, and set up incense on a table in the central hall. They opened the middle gate and knelt, waiting. Lord Xia Bingzhong, accompanied by a retinue of palace eunuchs, dismounted. Yet he had not come with any visible scroll or decree. He strode straight into the main hall, stood south-facing, and announced, “I bear a special command: Jia Zheng must enter the palace immediately and appear before His Majesty in the Linjing Hall.” Finishing, he declined any refreshment and left on horseback. Jia Zheng and the others had no idea what this might signify, but he swiftly changed clothes and departed for the court.

At the Rong Mansion, all were unsettled, dispatching riders back and forth to seek news. Two hours passed. Then Lai Da and several estate managers burst into the ceremonial gate, panting, “We have happy news and instructions from Master!” Grandmother Jia, who was anxious in the main hall, summoned them. Lady Xing, Lady Wang, You-shi, Li Wan, Wang Xifeng, Yingchun and her sisters, plus Aunt Xue, were all present, waiting. Lai Da bowed and said, “We do not know the details—only that Master says our young lady has been appointed to Fengzao Palace and named Worthy and Virtuous Consort. Master also instructed that the ladies must hurry into the palace to express gratitude.” Overjoyed, Grandmother Jia and the rest let out their collective relief. Smiles lit every face. At once they dressed formally and prepared. Grandmother Jia led Lady Xing, Lady Wang, and You-shi in four grand sedans, departing in procession. Jia She and Jia Zhen, wearing court attire, and accompanied by Jia Qiang and Jia Rong, escorted Grandmother Jia there.

Within both the Ning and Rong mansions, the household rumbled with celebration. Only Baoyu remained aloof. Why? Because, at that time, troubles weighed on him. Water Moon Convent’s nun Zhinen had secretly fled to the city to see Qin Zhong, but his father Qin Bangye discovered it, driving Zhinen out and flogging Qin Zhong. The shock and distress worsened Qin Bangye’s old illness, and after a few days, he died. Qin Zhong, already ill, suffered the beating, then watched his father die—grief upon grief—growing all the sicker. Thus Baoyu, seeing Qin Zhong’s plight, had no heart for the supposedly glorious news of Yuan-chun’s promotion. The older generation’s elaborate thanks in the palace, the waves of congratulatory visits from relatives, the bustle in both mansions—Baoyu took no interest, seeming ever more dazed and silent.

Presently, however, Jia Lian and Lin Daiyu were returning from Yangzhou. Word arrived: “They will arrive tomorrow.” At last, Baoyu brightened a bit. On inquiry, he learned that Jia Yucun was also entering the capital, recommended again by Lady Wang’s elder brother Wang Ziteng, hoping for a vacant post. Since he and Jia Lian were distantly related, and because he had taught Lin Daiyu, they had traveled together. Lin Ruhai’s remains had been buried in his ancestral grounds, all matters settled. Hearing that Yuan-chun had achieved Imperial favor, Jia Lian rushed day and night to get home earlier than planned. He traveled safely without incident. Baoyu, only caring how Lin Daiyu fared, asked no more.

Sure enough, by noon next day, a servant announced, “Second Master Lian and Miss Lin have arrived!” The family rushed out, greeting them with tears both sad and joyful, exchanging condolences and words of comfort. Baoyu beheld that Daiyu had grown even more ethereal. Daiyu herself brought many books, busied herself tidying her old room, placing her belongings. She shared writing materials with Baoyu, Baochai, and Yingchun. Baoyu, as an act of devotion, took out the Prince’s “Ling-fragrant” bead bracelet to offer her. Daiyu retorted, “It’s been in the hands of some foppish fellow—I won’t have it!” and tossed it back. Baoyu had no choice but to keep it himself.

Meanwhile, Jia Lian, back at his own quarters, found Wang Xifeng embroiled in pressing affairs. She managed to spare a moment to greet his return. In private, she teased, “Most honored brother-in-law, your travels must have been grueling. I heard from the first courier who arrived that you’d be back around now, so I prepared a small feast—would you deign to join me for a cup?” Jia Lian replied with a grin, “How dare I refuse your graciousness!” Ping’er and the other maids finished their respects, bringing tea. Jia Lian asked for an update, thanking Wang Xifeng for all her tireless managing. She gave a bitter little laugh, “I can’t manage much. My knowledge is shallow, my speech clumsy, my heart too forthright. I’m easily fooled with flattery, or I’ll be too tenderhearted to refuse people. Besides, I’ve never handled large affairs. I barely sleep when Lady Wang feels the slightest upset. I tried several times to resign, but she refused, claiming I only want the perks and won’t learn properly. No one realizes I’m sweating bullets, my lips sealed, tiptoeing around the older household women. They’re all too formidable, quick to pick a fight or speak in riddles, or they stand aside hoping for me to stumble. Others try sowing discord or push me into conflicts. Meanwhile, I’m still young, not intimidating to them. So how can I keep them in line? And about poor Qin-shi’s funeral—Brother Zhen pleaded with Lady Wang to have me help for a while, I tried so hard to refuse, but she insisted. The outcome turned the place upside down. He still regrets it. So tomorrow, do put in a word with him, explaining that I’m too green, had no choice but to comply.” Jia Lian was about to respond when a maid called out from outside, “Madam Xue’s sending Xiangling to ask something, so I told her and sent her back.” Jia Lian laughed, “I just saw Aunt Xue, and passing her was a pretty young maid—someone new. Aunt Xue told me it was that orphan girl from the lawsuit, once known as Xiangling, who’s become a concubine for that idiot Xue Pan. She looked quite lovely. Pity she’s wasted on that fool!” Wang Xifeng pouted, “So you just came from Suzhou, yet still drool at girls. If you’re so taken, I’ll trade you Ping’er for that Xiangling. As for that big oaf, he’s had the nerve to chase other women constantly. Once he got Xiangling, he promptly lost interest in her, rarely mentioning her name.” Suddenly, a runner from the second gate announced, “Old Master summons you in the main study.” Jia Lian, swallowing his final mouthful of tea, was off.

Wang Xifeng asked Ping’er, “What did Aunt Xue actually want by sending Xiangling?” Ping’er smiled, “No Xiangling came at all—I only said that because I needed a quick excuse. You see, that caretaker’s wife arrived delivering your monthly interest, choosing right now to do it, exactly when Master Lian’s back. If he discovered you’ve collected extra private funds, he’d take it for himself. So I quickly confronted her outside and dismissed her, then to keep you from asking, I made up the Xiangling story. Otherwise, it’d slip out in front of Master Lian.” Wang Xifeng laughed, “I wondered why Aunt Xue would send her so abruptly. You sly wench.”

Soon Jia Lian returned, telling them to serve wine. Husband and wife sat. Wang Xifeng, though she handled liquor well, refrained from overindulging. Halfway through, Jia Lian’s wet nurse, Nanny Zhao, arrived. They politely offered her wine, seating her on a low stool near the kang table. Jia Lian placed a couple of dishes for her. Wang Xifeng commented, “Everything’s too tough for you, it’ll hurt your teeth.” She told Ping’er, “I mentioned that bowl of ham stewed with pork knuckle—tender enough for Nanny. Why not bring it warmed up?” She then invited Nanny Zhao to try some of the Huichuan wine Jia Lian had brought, urging her to drink. Nanny Zhao remarked, “I will! But, my dear, do not have too many cups yourself. The reason I came isn’t for food or drink—there’s something I must beg of you: Our master’s words are never reliable. I reared him from infancy, but as I age, I have two sons who rely on me. Could you possibly look after them, since others dare not meddle if you speak up? You promised me, yet it’s come to nothing so far. Now we have that huge joyful news, so many positions to fill. If I must rely on our master, I’ll starve.” Xifeng smiled, “Nanny, your two sons are under my protection. From infancy, your boy had that temperament, giving his goodwill to random outsiders, not to those inside. If you love your kids, who can object? Without me, you’d let them be overshadowed. Don’t let outsiders benefit. Actually, I shouldn’t say ‘outsiders’—you evidently see them as insiders.” Everyone burst out laughing, and Nanny Zhao joined in. “It’s so. I am old and foolish. I just want them properly placed. So you’re my only hope.” Jia Lian sat there awkwardly. He joked, “Let’s not gossip like that—time to finish our meal. I need to go discuss business with Cousin Zhen.” Wang Xifeng said, “Yes, we mustn’t hold you up. By the way, what did Father want you for earlier?” Jia Lian replied, “He asked about building a retreat for the ‘visitation from the palace.’” Wang Xifeng brightened, “So the visit is truly approved?” Jia Lian said, “Not fully certain, but about eighty to ninety percent sure.” Wang Xifeng exclaimed, “Such imperial favor—unheard of! Only in old stories do we see anything like it.” Nanny Zhao, confused, asked, “I’ve heard people fussing about a ‘visitation’ or not. Now it’s happening? Why exactly?” Jia Lian answered, “His present Majesty, an Emperor of filial virtue, contemplates how official families long parted from their daughters in the palace must yearn to see them, and the daughters to see their parents. He himself laments how even though he serves the Emperor Emeritus and Empress Dowager day and night, he can’t fully express his own filial devotion. Therefore, he proposed that the consorts’ families may enter the palace on certain days to visit. But further, the Emperor Emeritus and Empress Dowager recognized that meeting in the palace is restricted by ceremony, so they extended more grace: if a family has suitable grounds to host an imperial visit, the palace could come to them, letting mother and daughter genuinely enjoy time together. The decree was thus. Everyone is thrilled. Lord Zhou’s daughter is building a special garden at home. Lord Wu’s also gone scouting an estate. Ours is likely next, so we must hurry.” “Amitabha,” said Nanny Zhao. “So that means we’ll be preparing for Lady Jia’s homecoming?” Jia Lian nodded, “Exactly so. That’s why we’re abuzz.” Wang Xifeng cried, “If it is so, I can see a grand spectacle at last. Pity I wasn’t born thirty years earlier to experience the times the seniors talk about—Taizu Emperor’s tours, more elaborate than reading a novel. We younger ones missed it.” Nanny Zhao eagerly chimed in, “That was a once-in-a-thousand-years event. I was but a small child, but I recall your Jia clan in Suzhou and Yangzhou building ships, repairing coastal banks for an imperial visit, spending silver like water. If I tried telling all of it…” Xifeng interjected, “Our Wang family had the same. My grandfather managed foreign tribute. All overseas envoys were in our care. The southwestern seaboard’s ships, cargo—ours.” “Who doesn’t know that?” said Nanny Zhao. “A local adage says, ‘If the Eastern Sea lacks a white jade bed, the Dragon King asks the Jinling Wang.’ Everyone knows. Then there’s the Zhen family in Jiangnan, also unbelievably grand. I saw with my own eyes, or no one would believe it. They hosted the Emperor four times. Money was like dirt. They had everything in mountains. They forgot any talk of ‘wasteful extravagance’!” Xifeng: “I’ve heard as much from our father. Hard not to believe. But how on earth did they become so rich?” Nanny Zhao: “In short, they used imperial silver for imperial visits. Who else can afford such displays?” In the midst of conversation, word arrived that Lady Wang had asked if Xifeng had finished eating. Realizing she was needed, Xifeng hurried. But a second gate runner reported, “Lord Ning’s heirs, Jia Rong and Jia Qiang, are here.” Jia Lian, just rinsing his mouth, indicated to Ping’er to bring a basin. Hearing them, Xifeng paused. Jia Rong began, “Father sends me to inform Uncle Lian: The elders have decided to link the eastern side of the estate from the Ning Mansion’s garden to the northwest side, measuring three and a half li, for building the new ‘Visitation Retreat.’ We’ve ordered a draftsman to deliver plans tomorrow. Father said Uncle must be tired from travel, so there’s no need to come over tonight. Please come tomorrow morning.” Jia Lian nodded, “Much appreciated. That plan is simplest—no sense seeking a remote location that’s unbefitting. If the elders want to change again, do persuade them otherwise. I’ll visit tomorrow.” Jia Rong concurred. Jia Qiang then reported, “I’m assigned to Suzhou for hiring performers, acquiring new female musicians, and obtaining instruments. Elder Master also told me to come see Uncle.” Jia Lian eyed him: “Are you up to it? It’s not complicated, but it has hidden pitfalls.” Jia Qiang grinned, “I’ll just do my best.” Xifeng intervened, “No need to fret—your father’s not expecting you to bargain yourself. He’s giving you a chance to practice. It’s fine.” Jia Lian smiled, “Yes, yes. All right, but take care.” He then asked, “Which funds do we use?” Qiang said, “They decided not to bring silver from the capital. The Zhen family in Jiangnan still owes us fifty thousand taels. We’ll have a note for them, collecting thirty thousand now, leaving twenty in deposit to buy the ornamental lanterns, candles, draperies, and such.” Jia Lian approved. Xifeng said to Jia Qiang: “I have two reliable men for you to take along. This is your lucky break.” Jia Qiang gleefully answered, “I’d hoped Aunt would lend me a few good staff.” He asked for their names. Xifeng turned to Nanny Zhao, who had grown so engrossed she’d fallen silent. Ping’er nudged her. She quickly snapped to, “Yes—Zhao Tianliang and Zhao Tiandong.” Xifeng said, “Don’t forget. I’ll do my own errands now.” She stepped away. Jia Rong followed her out and quietly offered, “Aunt, what might you like from Suzhou? Let me bring something as thanks.” Xifeng smirked, “Don’t talk nonsense! I’m not interested in hush-hush gifts. I’m not starved for your stuff.” She laughed and walked off. Jia Qiang tried the same with Jia Lian, who only replied, “You’re hasty, learning cunning ways. If I need anything, I’ll just send word.” With that, the two parted. Soon, more people came with minor issues. Exhausted, Jia Lian told the gate to refuse any further visitors until tomorrow. Xifeng waited until the third watch to rest, ending the night peacefully.

Next morning, Jia Lian visited Jia She and Jia Zheng, then went to the Ning Mansion to gather the old stewards, plus some family confidants, to plan and measure the future site. They would combine the east side of Ning Mansion’s Huifang Garden with the eastern courtyards of the Rong Mansion, demolishing outbuildings in the small alley between them, merging the water source from the north. They would move rock, plant bamboo, shape hills, all supervised by one Hu Shan-Ziye. Jia Zheng, disliking mundane tasks, left it to Jia She, Jia Zhen, Jia Lian, Lai Da, Lai Sheng, Lin Zhixiao, Wu Xindeng, Zhan Guang, Cheng Rixing, and so forth. He merely appeared to check progress or briefly consult. Jia She mostly reclined at home, allowing them to bring reports or short notes. Jia Zhen and Lai Da assigned laborers for building or carting materials. They dismantled walls, reformed the garden, bridging a new waterway. The entire estate hummed with noise and work. We cannot detail it all.

Baoyu, seeing the mansion so busy, realized Jia Zheng had no time to press him about his studies. He felt freer. Yet he worried about Qin Zhong, whose condition worsened daily. One morning, after washing and dressing, he meant to inform Grandmother Jia that he would go visit Qin Zhong, only to see Mingyan furtively waiting near the second gate. Alarmed, Baoyu asked, “What is it?” Mingyan said, “Qin Zhong can’t hold on.” Baoyu’s heart lurched: “But I saw him just recently, fairly coherent. How did he worsen so quickly?” Mingyan answered, “No idea—someone from his household told me.” Baoyu rushed back to inform Grandmother Jia. She said, “Take reliable servants, pay your respects, but do not linger. If his house is in chaos, come back soon.” Baoyu hurriedly changed clothes. Impatiently waiting for a carriage, he paced anxiously. At last the carriage arrived; Li Gui, Mingyan, and others accompanied him. They reached Qin’s gate to find it silent. Entering the inner rooms, they startled Qin Zhong’s distant aunts, sisters, and sisters-in-law, who fled in modesty.

Qin Zhong had already fallen unconscious two or three times, having been moved from his bed. Baoyu took one look and burst into tears. Li Gui tried to calm him: “This is a delicate, chronic ailment—he’s only been moved off the kang for comfort. If you cry too loudly, it’ll worsen his condition.” Baoyu then choked back his sobs, moved closer, and saw Qin Zhong’s face pale as wax, eyes closed, chest heaving faintly. Baoyu called softly, “Qin brother, it’s me, Baoyu.” Repeatedly he called, but Qin Zhong did not respond.

Unbeknownst to them, Qin Zhong’s spirit was indeed on the verge of departure, half in dreams: In that dream-state, ghosts brandished placards and chains, calling him away. Qin Zhong resisted, worried about his fatherless household, anxious about Zhinen’s uncertain fate, pleading with the underworld officials. But those ghostly constables refused, snapping, “You’re a scholar—don’t you know the adage: ‘When King Yama orders your death at third watch, who dares keep you alive till fifth watch?’ In the nether realm, we’re impartial. Don’t speak of personal ties.” Panicked, Qin Zhong clung to faint hopes. Suddenly, from somewhere, Baoyu’s voice echoed, “Brother Whale, I’ve come.” Qin Zhong’s soul told the underworld minions, “Spare me a moment to see my dear friend Baoyu…” The presiding official frowned, “Why mention that name? Baoyu’s fortune is strong. Let him not entangle us. Release this soul for a bit.” The lesser spirits, grumbling, now found themselves forced to comply…

Whether Qin Zhong lives or dies is left to the next chapter.
CHAPTER 17
When Qin Whale-Youth Dies, Bao-yu Mourns Bitterly;
The Great Prospect Garden is Completed, and the Rong Mansion Prepares an Imperial Homecoming

Qin Zhong’s passing left Baoyu inconsolable, weeping uncontrollably, until Li Gui and others, with great effort, managed to calm him. Even so, he returned home bearing lingering sorrow. Grandmother Jia contributed several dozen taels of silver for funeral expenses and prepared a ceremonial offering, which Baoyu brought to pay his respects. After seven days, the burial took place, with no further details recorded; Baoyu merely continued to grieve for days on end, powerless to alter fate. Over time, it subsided somewhat.

During this period, word came from Jia Zhen and the others informing Jia Zheng: “All construction in the new garden is complete. Lord She has inspected it; now we await your review. If any details are amiss, we can adjust them, after which we’ll compose the plaques and matching couplets.” Jia Zheng reflected for a moment. “Indeed, writing the horizontal plaques and couplets will be difficult. Proper ceremony suggests that the newly honored Imperial Consort should bestow names upon the sites; but if the Consort cannot personally view each scene in advance, how can she fitly choose them all? Nor can we wait until she visits and only then decide the names; that would leave the entire garden unlabeled, its landscape and architecture lacking captions, which would diminish their charm.”

Several of the scholar-guests replied, “The Master’s point is valid. However, the garden’s plaques cannot simply go without. Perhaps we can temporarily assign approximate or provisional names, drawn from the place’s nature—two characters, or three, or four. We can hang them as lantern inscriptions, so that for the Consort’s visit, they won’t be entirely blank. Later, once she sees the scenes, we request formal names from her, fulfilling the proper course. This way, we have coverage on both sides.” Jia Zheng nodded. “That seems sensible. Let’s do so. This very day, if the weather is mild, we can stroll inside. I’ll attempt to name them, or else we might later call upon Yu-cun if needed.” The guests declared, “If the Master’s own compositions are set, there’s no need for Yu-cun.”

Jia Zheng smiled, “Don’t overpraise. I had little skill in scenic verses from my youth, and my official burdens leave me more out of touch with these refined amusements. Even if I compose, it’ll be mediocre, risking lessening the garden’s appeal. Possibly better to propose what I can and see if we can collectively refine it.” The guests quickly responded, “Excellent. And fortune’s with us in the fine weather—let’s proceed.” So he stood up and led them forth. Jia Zhen went ahead to alert staff in the garden.

At that moment, Baoyu (still low in spirits over Qin Zhong) had been told by Grandmother Jia to amuse himself in the newly built grounds. When he spotted Jia Zhen entering, Jia Zhen teasingly said, “Off you go now! Your father is on his way.” Alarmed, Baoyu darted out, only to run straight into Jia Zheng leading his retinue. With no chance to hide, he stepped aside. Jia Zheng, remembering how Master Dai-ru had recently praised Baoyu’s knack for poetic couplets—though at the expense of his classical studies—decided to test him. He summoned him to join the inspection. Baoyu, unsure of his father’s intent, had to comply.

Arriving at the garden gate, Jia Zhen stood ready with many attendants. Jia Zheng said, “Lock these doors for now; we’ll view the exterior first before going in.” Jia Zhen had them closed. Jia Zheng inspected the façade: five main gates, roofed in tubular tiles, with fish-scale ridges, their door frames and lattice entirely carved in new and intricate patterns, without red or gold paint. All was simply polished with water-ground plaster for the walls and white stone steps with exotic carvings. Left and right were pure white plaster walls on a foundation of “tiger-skin” patterned stone, free from gaudy decoration. Jia Zheng nodded in approval. “Open up; let us enter.”

Inside, they met a tall hill blocking the view. Everyone said, “What a fine mountain!” Jia Zheng remarked, “But for this hill, the entire garden’s vistas would be revealed in one glance—where would be the charm?” They all agreed. “Indeed, if not for a mind harboring hidden hills and valleys, how would one conceive of placing it here!” They moved forward, gazing at white rocks shaped like specters or beasts, standing upright in clusters, covered with moss and vines. At intervals, winding footpaths vanished among them. Jia Zheng said, “We’ll follow this narrow path in, circle around, then exit on the far side, so as to see everything.” Summoning Jia Zhen to lead, he supported Baoyu with an arm, winding into the hillside path.

They soon saw a glistening slab of bright stone, seemingly a natural signboard, perfect for inscribing a name. Jia Zheng turned to ask, “All of you, what name shall we carve here?” The guests offered random suggestions: some said “Diecui” (“Folded Emerald”), others “Jinzhang” (“Embroidered Cliffs”), or “Saixianglu” (“Surpassing Fragrant Furnace”), or “Xiao Zhongnan” (“Little Zhongnan”). In truth, each was quite commonplace. Everyone, in fact, was giving perfunctory suggestions, expecting Baoyu’s father to test Baoyu next. Baoyu, aware, now heard Jia Zheng say, “Let’s have Baoyu propose a name.”

Baoyu answered, “I recall a line from the ancients: ‘Better to cite tradition than forcibly coin new phrases; older forms surpass ephemeral flourishes.’ Moreover, this area isn’t the garden’s primary peak but simply the approach to deeper scenery. Instead of naming it anew, we might carve on it an old verse, say ‘A Twisting Path Leads to Hidden Realms,’ which would be both graceful and apt.” Everyone murmured approval, praising Baoyu’s aptness. Jia Zheng smiled, “Do not flatter him too much. The boy has read a smattering and is apt at trifling remarks, that’s all. Let’s keep walking.”

Through a small cave, they emerged to see lush foliage, bright blossoms, a rivulet trickling through dense vegetation into a stone crevice. Proceeding a few steps north, the terrain opened, revealing two wings of lofty towers, their carved eaves barely visible through the hills and the branches. At the base, a white marble pool glimmered, with three arched stone bridges, spouting water from beast-headed drains. Atop one bridge stood a pavilion. Jia Zheng and his party entered the structure to sit, asking, “What should we call this site?” They proposed borrowing Ouyang Xiu’s phrase “Yiran Pavilion,” referencing his “Essay on the Drunken Old Man’s Pavilion.” Jia Zheng said, “Decent, but it rests upon a body of water. Perhaps we need a name more suited to water. I think we might adopt from Ouyang Xiu’s text about a spring that ‘pours between two peaks,’ using the word ‘Pours.’” A companion exclaimed, “Yes, how about ‘Pouring Jade’?”

Yet Baoyu argued, “Using ‘pours’ is reminiscent of Ouyang Xiu’s references, which might feel repetitive. Besides, this is for an imperial family retreat; such a coarse word might not be elegant. Perhaps a gentler, more euphemistic name like ‘Qinfang’ (Fragrant Inflow) would be better.” Jia Zheng stroked his beard but said nothing. Everyone else again praised Baoyu, calling his suggestion extraordinary. Jia Zheng declared, “The label is easy, but let’s see him produce a 7-character couplet as well.” Baoyu promptly intoned:

“Where willows hug the banks, new emeralds cluster in the scull’s path;
Across the water, blooms diffuse their fragrance in a single breath.”
Jia Zheng nodded quietly, awarding only a faint smile while moving on.

They traversed various small mountains and streams, sometimes a patch of thick blossoms or unusual stones. Abruptly, they saw ahead a pink-stucco perimeter and multiple rooms behind tall bamboo groves. The entire group exclaimed, “What a lovely hideaway!” They entered, finding twisting corridors with paved stone floors, leading to three modest rooms with an attached side storeroom. Out back was a second courtyard holding a tall pear tree and broad-leaf banana plants, plus two smaller rooms. The rear compound’s perimeter included a trickle of water from a spring, a narrow channel just a foot wide. Winding around the eaves and courtyard, it eventually exited near stands of bamboo. Jia Zheng mused aloud, “If one sat here reading under the moon, life would not be ill spent.” He then eyed Baoyu with significance, startling the boy into lowering his head. The others quickly changed the subject. Two guests suggested a four-character plaque referencing “Qishui Yifeng” or “Suiyuan Yiji,” which sounded derivative. Jia Zheng laughed and said, “Let Baoyu try.” Then, ironically, he scolded, “He only knows how to critique others’ suggestions. Let’s see him propose something.” Baoyu apologized and said, “Those references also strike me as unideal. Because this is the first station for an imperial homecoming, we must emphasize praise for the throne. A borrowed phrase might be better. The four characters ‘You Feng Lai Yi’ (A Phoenix Cometh) would be fitting.” Everyone cheered. Jia Zheng sneered, “A rude beast, but a small glimmer of insight.” Then he insisted, “And produce a matching couplet.” Baoyu promptly offered:

“Fragrant tea’s warmth lingers after idle cups, the rising steam still green;
Chess matches end in a quiet window, where just-touched pieces remain cool.”
Jia Zheng murmured it was “not that fine” but pressed forward. They left by another door, glimpsing only half the garden. Then attendants arrived with word that someone had come from Yu-cun’s quarters. Seeing the time, Jia Zheng said, “We can’t view it all. Let’s exit from the far side for a quick look around.”

They crossed a grand bridge spanning waters so transparent they resembled crystal curtains. This was the main sluice gate connecting the outside river to an inner creek. Jia Zheng asked, “What do we call this floodgate?” Baoyu replied, “Since the creek is named ‘Qin Fang’ or ‘Fragrant Inflow,’ call it ‘Fragrant Inflow Gate.’” Jia Zheng exclaimed, “Ridiculous. No more ‘Fragrant’ references!”

So they continued on, encountering huts, huts, rocks, or flower-arched gates, or cunningly placed illusions, or a hidden nunnery or hermitage. The air filled with the hum of carpentry. By midday, they’d seen but a portion. Jia Zheng, weary of walking, eventually glimpsed a courtyard in front. “Let’s rest there,” he said, leading the group inside. A moon-gate of bamboo lattices opened to an inner yard dotted with ornamental stones, overshadowed by a pair of banana trees on one side and a single crabapple tree on the other, its branches drooping with bright blossoms. The group admired it, remarking how especially exuberant the blooms were. Jia Zheng said, “That’s a ‘daughter crabapple,’ apparently an exotic breed from abroad. People say it came from a so-called Daughter Kingdom, but that’s likely just a fanciful rumor.”

Baoyu added, “Poets often see it as a flower that appears delicate, ruddy, and faint, reminiscent of a young maiden’s grace, hence calling it a ‘daughter flower.’ Over time, rumor turned it literal, as if from a Daughter Kingdom.” Delighted by his explanation, the crowd sat along a side veranda. Jia Zheng asked for a name, and one guest proposed “Chong Guang Fan Cai” (“Exalted Radiance, Shimmering Colors”). Another suggested “Jiao He” (“Banana and Crabapple”). Baoyu said, “We can’t ignore the idea that both banana and crabapple appear together, signifying ‘red’ and ‘green.’ If we name only one, we lose the other.” Jia Zheng responded, “What do you suggest?” Baoyu said, “Perhaps four characters: ‘Hong Xiang Lu Yu’ (Red Perfume and Green Jade). That would do them both justice.” Jia Zheng again shook his head, “No.”

They entered the central hall, discovering elaborate openwork partitions carved with designs of clouds, bats, pines, or mountains, each shaped or inset with archaic vases or stands—exquisitely wrought. Some sections had bright embroidered gauze, others had tinted glass windows. Low cabinets displayed rare trifles. Everyone marveled, praising the skill. Jia Zheng wandered a short distance and found it quite confusing, with decorative screens reflecting back, revealing illusions of more doorways. He almost collided with a giant mirror. Jia Zhen offered to guide him out. They twisted and turned, eventually finding a side exit leading to an open courtyard full of climbing roses. Then the path ended at a little creek. Surprised, they asked, “Where does this water come from?” Jia Zhen explained how they’d channeled side streams from the northeast hill, letting them merge again west of the outer walls. The group applauded the ingenuity. They again skirted a hillside, nearly losing their way. At last they emerged, returning outside.

Baoyu, anxious to see his female cousins, was forced to follow Jia Zheng back to the study. Suddenly, Jia Zheng recalled something. “What are you still doing? Grandmother will want you—haven’t you had enough wandering?” Baoyu excused himself. Retainers teased him outside, “We’re all grateful your father was pleased with you. The old madam asked for you repeatedly, but we told her you were impressing your father. So how about a reward?” Baoyu laughed, “I’ll give each of you a string of cash.” They insisted, “We’ve seen strings of cash before—give us that embroidered pouch you wear.” One after another, they tugged away his pouches, rummaging for fans, not letting him refuse. They walked him back to Grandmother Jia’s quarters, boasting about it along the way.

Inside, Grandmother Jia had indeed been waiting. Seeing him returned safe, she felt relieved. Soon Xiren brought him tea, noticing that Baoyu’s ornaments were all gone. She teased him for letting them be snatched. Lin Daiyu overheard and teased, “So the embroidered pouch I gave you is gone to those rascals? Don’t expect anything more from me.” She turned away angrily, picking up a half-finished sachet that Baoyu had requested, and snipped it to pieces in frustration. Baoyu saw that and rushed over, vexed that she’d destroyed it. But rummaging inside his collar, he proudly revealed a different pouch, presenting it to Daiyu. “Look, I still kept yours inside, so no one could take it.” Realizing he had guarded it next to his skin, she felt regret at her rash act. She lowered her head in silence. Baoyu half-jokingly said, “It seems you never truly meant to give me anything. If so, I’ll return it all.” He flung it at her. Daiyu flared up, tears in her eyes, and took up her scissors again. Baoyu scrambled to seize her hand, apologizing in frantic terms.

Just then Grandmother Jia called for Baoyu, so maids said he was in Miss Lin’s room. The old lady said with a laugh, “Good, let them amuse themselves. Just keep them from quarreling.” Indeed, Daiyu was crying, but Baoyu coaxed her, calling her “dear sister” this and that, until she finally relented. She threatened, “You only want to disturb me—I’ll leave you.” She made to storm off. Baoyu followed. “Wherever you go, I go,” he insisted. Then he took the same pouch and put it on again. Daiyu tried to snatch it. “Weren’t you discarding it a moment ago? Isn’t it shameful to wear it now?” Laughing, Baoyu retorted, “You silly dear sister,” and she eventually broke into a smile. “Well, maybe someday I’ll make you another sachet, if I feel like it.” And together they moved to Lady Wang’s quarters, where they found Baochai present.

Amid all this, Lady Wang’s side of the house brimmed with lively commotion: Jia Qiang had returned from Suzhou with twelve newly purchased young actresses, plus a teaching instructor and theatrical costumes. Aunt Xue had moved to a peaceful set of rooms in the northeast corner, so they could use Lixiang Courtyard to rehearse the young troupe. Additionally, older serving-women who had once performed songs were assigned to oversee. Jia Qiang was in charge of finances, ensuring all daily wages and supplies. Then Lin Zhixiao arrived with news: “We’ve purchased twelve or so little nuns and female novices as well. We have the new Taoist robes ready—twenty sets. Among them is one ‘Half-Shorn’ nun from Suzhou. Her ancestors were scholarly officials, but after repeated ailments, she turned to religious vows, which cured her. She’s around eighteen, named Miaoyu, orphaned now, accompanied by two elderly maids and a small serving-girl. She’s well-versed in letters, proficient in sutras, and said to be quite pretty. She came to the capital last year, lodging at the Moni Temple west of the city. Her teacher, adept at prophecy, died last winter, leaving instructions that she must remain in the capital for her karmic destiny. She refuses to return south.”

Lady Wang remarked, “We might invite her here.” Lin Zhixiao’s wife responded, “She says, ‘I fear aristocratic houses will try to dominate me. I won’t go!’ So we must treat her with courtesy. Perhaps a polite invitation, a letter of respect. Then she might come.” Lady Wang agreed. “Yes, let’s have an official note written, then tomorrow send a carriage to see if she’ll accept.” With that, Lin Zhixiao’s wife left to find a secretary who could write a formal invitation. They would dispatch it next day along with a grand sedan to escort Miaoyu.

What transpired thereafter awaits the next chapter.
CHAPTER 18
The Emperor’s Generous Favor Lets the Imperial Concubine Return Home;
Within a Joyous Family Gathering, Bao-yu Reveals His Literary Skills

At that time, a report arrived from the construction site: workers awaited a supply of gauze and silk to paste over various structures, and they summoned Lady Wang Xifeng to unlock the storeroom. Another messenger came, requesting her to inspect the gold and silver vessels now ready. Lady Wang and her maids in the main residence were all too busy. Therefore, Bao-chai suggested to Baoyu and the others: “We’re only in their way here; let’s go over to Cousin Yingchun’s place.” Thus they departed for Yingchun’s quarters.

Because Lady Wang had been caught up in endless bustle day after day, it wasn’t until the tenth month that all was finally arranged. Supervisors and craftsmen had accounted for everything; the new array of antique curios and literary ornaments had been placed; they had also purchased all manner of birds—cranes, deer, rabbits, chickens, geese, and more—distributed around the garden for rearing. From Jia Qiang’s side came another set of amusements: 20-some miscellaneous plays were ready for performance; also, the new group of novices—small nuns and little Taoist girls—had learned to recite Buddhist and Daoist liturgies. With these tasks done, Jia Zheng felt somewhat at ease and submitted a memorial. After it was presented, an imperial decree arrived declaring: “On the fifteenth day, the Lantern Festival of the coming New Year, the honored Imperial Concubine will return home for a visit.” The Jia family, upon receiving this command, scrambled into renewed, hectic labor, leaving them barely able to celebrate the New Year in any proper manner.

In the blink of an eye, the Lantern Festival drew near. Starting from the eighth day of the first month, an advance group of palace eunuchs arrived to survey directions: which rooms would serve as dressing chambers, which halls for banquets, which places for receiving salutations, which areas for rest—each detail had to follow palace protocol. There were also “censor-eunuchs” in charge of local security, with many lesser eunuchs establishing boundaries, marking out where the Jias themselves could or could not enter, how the meal service would proceed, and how petitions would be offered. Meanwhile, outside, officials from the Ministry of Works and the Five Wards Cavalry patrolled the streets, clearing all bystanders. Jia She and others supervised artisans making flower lanterns and fireworks. By the fourteenth night, everything was prepared. None in the household slept.

By the predawn hours of the fifteenth day, from Grandmother Jia on down, those of noble rank were splendidly attired according to their station. The newly completed garden was now hung with dancing dragon drapes, embroidered phoenix curtains, gold and silver sparkling, gems radiating brilliance. In tall vessels, they burned “hundred-blend” incense. Vases were filled with flowers that symbolized eternal spring. It was perfectly hushed, not a cough to be heard. Jia She and the male clan lined up at the west street gate, while Grandmother Jia and the women lined up at the main gate of the Rong Mansion. Street corners were screened off with high curtains. After a long, tedious wait, a single eunuch on horseback arrived to see Jia Zheng. The eunuch said, “It’s still too early. The Emperor took supper at around the first watch, then performed devotions at Bao-ling Palace, then at You-chu he'll watch the palace lanterns and request permission to depart. Likely by the first half of the ‘xū’ hour [7–9 pm] she’ll be on her way.” Hearing this, Lady Feng remarked, “Then Grandmother and the madams can return to rest awhile. They need only come out again at the proper time.” So Grandmother Jia and her group withdrew, leaving Feng-jie to coordinate in the garden. The eunuchs were entertained with wine and food. Meanwhile, another group of attendants carried in tall candles and lit them at each vantage point.

Suddenly, from outside came the clamor of horses. About a dozen eunuchs rushed in, clapping their hands. The eunuchs who’d been stationed within recognized the signal that the time was near, so each took their assigned place. Jia She led the entire clan outside the west street gate; Grandmother Jia and the women stood outside the main gate to welcome the arrivals. Curtains and screens blocked the view from the street. After some waiting, all was perfectly still, until pairs of eunuchs on horseback began trickling in, halting at the gate, dismounting and letting their mounts be led away outside. Then more pairs appeared, until about ten. Then faint music and drums echoed in the distance.

The procession advanced: pairs of phoenix- and dragon-banners, peacock-feather fans, gold burners exhaling imperial incense, followed by a curved golden parasol with seven phoenixes. Then came the retinue of noble attendants, each holding embroidered cloths, handkerchiefs, rinse bowls, dust-whisks, and so forth. With those vanguard units past, at last emerged eight eunuchs bearing an imperial palanquin of golden top and goose-yellow embroidered with phoenixes, moving slowly forward. Grandmother Jia and the others immediately knelt. A eunuch advanced to help them up: “No need, no need.” They lifted the palanquin through the main gate, heading east to a courtyard specifically prepared, where another group of eunuchs set it down and announced, “Please dismount to change robes.” So inside they went, the eunuchs dispersing while Zhaorong, Cai-pin, and others assisted the Imperial Concubine. She gazed around, noticing all the brilliant lanterns of embroidered silk, intricately wrought. Over the front entrance was a lantern plaque reading “Blessed by Virtue with Compassion.” She changed into more comfortable attire, then returned to her palanquin to continue into the garden.

At once, curling incense smoke drifted among extravagantly decorated scenery. Everywhere, lights gleamed in myriad colors, subtle music drifting on the air, capturing a sense of calm prosperity, grandiose yet refined. Inside the sedan, the Imperial Concubine (whom we now call “Yuan-chun”) looked out at the garden’s vistas. She sighed, “This is too extravagant, an excess of expense!” Approaching the next location, the leading eunuchs invited her to transfer onto a small barge. She stepped down into a boat, noticing that the channel’s water sparkled like transparent crystals. Both sides of the marble rails bristled with countless crystal glass lamps, shining bright as snow or silver. Overhead, the trees—though lacking real blossoms—were decorated with silk and paper flowers. Lanterns dangled from every branch. On the water itself floated crafted lotus, waterweeds, mandarin ducks, and herons, all shaped from shells or feathers, all shimmering in colored light, as though the entire scene were a realm of glass and pearls. The barge was itself bedecked with potted plants, shimmering curtains, and sweet-smelling blossoms.

Soon they arrived at a stone water inlet with a sign reading “Lotus Banks and Flower Inlets.” Readers should note: in earlier chapters, we saw that “Lotus Banks and Flower Inlets,” “Where the Phoenix Alights,” etc., were merely trial names from that casual test of Baoyu’s verses. Typically, the Jia family—descended from an old line of refined culture—would have its own esteemed scholars finalize these. They wouldn’t rely on a boy’s casual lines. Yet here we see they truly used Baoyu’s suggestions. The reason is that the newly honored Imperial Consort was once a daughter living at home, doted on by Grandmother Jia. Once Baoyu was born, he became her younger brother, and she had taught him basic reading before he even started formal school. She loved him like a son. Entering the palace, she was ever mindful of him, often sending word to encourage Jia Zheng: “Don’t spoil him; he must be taught well, but not too harshly.” So upon hearing Baoyu had displayed some literary flair, Jia Zheng tested him in the garden. Those lines—though not deeply polished—still reflected the household’s tradition. The Imperial Consort, wanting to glimpse what her dear younger brother had devised, happily accepted them, further fulfilling her sense of familial longing. And places Baoyu hadn’t finished naming that day were likewise assigned to him later.

Yuan-chun noticed the words “Lotus Banks and Flower Inlets,” frowned, and said with a slight smile, “The last half, ‘flower inlets’ is fine enough, but ‘lotus banks’ is unnecessary.” The eunuch on the barge hopped ashore to relay this. Jia Zheng quickly had the first part changed. The barge carried on. Soon they reached a grand stone archway with a plaque reading “Heavenly Immortal’s Precious Mirror.” Yuan-chun directed it be renamed “Imperial Homecoming Villa.” Then they reached the primary “Receiving Hall,” which dazzled with bright torches and heavy incense, brilliant with floating canopies, embroidered windows, silver-latticed eaves, painting a picture of:

Jade doors and golden gates, a celestial realm,
A palace of cassia and orchid, fit for a consort’s grace.
They asked Yuan-chun to ascend the dais and receive her family’s homage. The orchard orchestra began. Two eunuchs led Jia She, Jia Zheng, and all male kin onto the moon-platform to pay homage, but the concubine’s herald declared, “Exempt.” They withdrew. Then from the east steps rose Grandmother Jia, Lady Xing, Lady Wang, and You-shi, likewise formed in rows. Again the herald said, “Exempt.” So they also withdrew.

After triple service of tea, Yuan-chun left the dais. The music ceased. She retired to a side chamber to change attire, then set forth to the mansion’s main quarters to see her family in person. At the threshold of the main house, she intended to bow in the “household ceremony,” but Grandmother Jia and the others, weeping, rushed to prevent her kneeling. Seeing them, the concubine shed tears as well. She clasped one hand in Grandmother Jia’s, the other in Lady Wang’s. For a moment they strove to speak but only wept. Lady Xing, Li Wan, Wang Xifeng, Yingchun, Tan-chun, Xi-chun, and so on stood aside, tears dropping silently. After a long while, Yuan-chun forced a faint smile, choking out: “When they sent me away to that place where no one can be seen, I hoped for nothing but a homecoming day. But now that I return, you greet me with tears, making me even sadder. Once I depart again, who knows how long until we can meet.” These words deepened their sorrow. Only Xi-feng and the others managed to console them. They guided the concubine to her seat, each stepping forward in turn to pay respects, inevitably ending in sobs. Then from outside came a call for the mansion’s stewards and relatives to line up. The concubine sighed, “So many dear kin, yet I can’t meet them all.” Lady Wang explained that their in-laws the Xue family, with Aunt Xue, Bao-chai, and also Lin Daiyu awaited outside. “They hold no official rank and dare not enter unbidden.” So Yuan-chun summoned them. They arrived, ready to observe official etiquette, but Yuan-chun’s herald waived it. They simply approached, greeting each other intimately, also reuniting with old palace maids like Bao-qin who once served the household. Grandmother Jia swiftly invited them into a side chamber for refreshment. Meanwhile, lesser eunuchs and female officials, plus the staff from Ning House, from Jia She’s side, from the engineering teams, from the theatrical troupe, from the lamp-keepers—each had their own assigned place. So mother, daughters, sisters shared private talk of their separation and personal matters.

Soon Jia Zheng, from beyond the screen, signaled his intention to pay respects and repeat the formal father-daughter protocol. Yuan-chun commanded he skip the usual elaborate bows. Then she addressed her father: “Now the simplest rural families, living on meager pickled salt and cloth, can enjoy everyday closeness among parents and children. Yet we, though wealthy, must endure separation, which yields no delight.” Jia Zheng, tears in his own eyes, responded: “We are but meager servants from a minor household in the crow’s ranks. Who would expect fortune to bestow a phoenix? Yet your highness has soared on the Emperor’s grace, reflecting the paternal ancestors’ blessings. Indeed, our realm’s present Emperor embodies Heaven’s generative virtue, surpassing ancient times by allowing such visits. Even if we wore out heart and soul in service, how could we repay a tenth of this generosity? So let me only strive daily at my post, and may our Emperor reign ten thousand years, thus blessing the people forever. Daughter, do not worry for your aging father or mother. Look after your own health, preserving your upright, diligent service for the Emperor. That alone repays the court’s favor.” Yuan-chun also urged her father, “Attend diligently to affairs of state, rest in spare moments, and do not brood over me. The Emperor’s grace is broad. We can meet monthly or so. No need to fret.” Finishing, Jia Zheng withdrew. Then Yuan-chun asked, “Where is my younger brother Baoyu?” Grandmother Jia said, “He has no official rank and is outside, not daring to intrude.” Yuan-chun commanded him to be summoned. A eunuch guided Baoyu in. He performed the official family bow, but Yuan-chun told him, “Exempt,” then beckoned him close, holding him in her arms, patting his neck, saying with tears, “You’ve grown so tall—” but her voice caught in weeping.

Some ladies, such as You-shi and Xi-feng, softly approached to calm her. Baoyu bowed again. The concubine, recalling the old days, inquired how Baoyu was faring. Xi-feng or others answered. Time passed quickly, and the staff outside reminded them about the banquet arranged inside the garden. So Yuan-chun parted from the elders and, at the mention of tours and amusements, directed Baoyu to guide her. The procession thus continued to the garden gate, finding an array of illuminations. She first toured “Where the Phoenix Alights,” “Crimson Fragrance and Emerald Radiance,” “The Apricot Banner in Sight,” “Orchid Fragrance and Clear Grace,” meandering over pavilions and corridors. She commented on each newly decorated spot, praising extravagantly, but also cautioning against over-luxury. Arriving at the main hall, she dismounted from her palanquin to seat herself. They served a sumptuous feast, with Grandmother Jia and the women in attendance. Lady You, Lady Wang, Xi-feng, and others offered dishes and wine.

After the meal, Yuan-chun called for brush and ink, personally drafting titles for each location. She bestowed the official name “Great Prospect Garden” upon the entire enclosure, labeling the main hall “Recalling Virtue and Returning Grace,” with a couplet reading:

“From Heaven and Earth arises a vast benevolence,
So myriad children, so many souls, share in gratitude;
Across ancient and modern times, such wide-reaching acts abide,
This realm of nine provinces, ten thousand domains, all bathe in imperial favor.”
Then, seeing “Where the Phoenix Alights,” she renamed it “Xiaoxiang Lodge.” “Crimson Fragrance and Emerald Radiance” became “Happy Red, Quick Green,” or “Delightful Red Court.” “Orchid Fragrance and Clear Grace” turned “Orchid Mist Haven.” “The Apricot Banner in Sight” changed to “The Rice-Fragrant Village.” The main tower was titled “Great Prospect Tower.” East and west wings were “Embroidered Lattice Tower,” “Embracing Fragrance Pavilion,” and so on: “Lotus Breeze Hall,” “Lotus-Scented Chalet,” “Purple Waterweed Isle,” “Rippled Grass Shore.” She gave “Pear-Flower Spring Rain,” “Phoenix-Tree Autumn Wind,” and “Reed-Snow at Night” for certain hidden corners, plus many more. She then added a brief verse:

“Molded from hills and streams, skillfully wrought,
Much toil was spent before these scenes took form!
Lofty realms above or mortal realms below—
Both illusions are gathered in one splendid garden.”
She concluded, “Someday, in calmer moments, I shall expand this trifling verse into a fuller ‘Great Prospect Garden Record’ and a ‘Homecoming Tribute,’ but for tonight, these lines suffice. You, my sisters, shall also each compose a plaque and poem, for it would be a shame if you felt limited by my meager skill. I hear Baoyu can handle verse well. Excellent indeed. Among these spots, I especially favor ‘Xiaoxiang Lodge’ and ‘Orchid Mist Haven,’ next ‘Delightful Red Court’ and ‘Rice-Fragrant Village.’ For these four places, I want each to have not just a simple matching couplet but a five-character regulated poem. Let me read them now, so as not to slight your talents.” Baoyu had no choice but to attempt them.

Yingchun, Tan-chun, Xi-chun, and Li Wan all tried their best, though among them only Tan-chun was truly adept. Lin Daiyu and Xue Baochai easily excelled. Li Wan wrote something passable. The Imperial Concubine read them in turn, finding them all:

“Heart Freed, Temper Eased” (Yingchun’s title)
Yingchun’s poem, paraphrased.
“Graceful Literature and Scenery” (Tan-chun’s)
“Nature’s Writing Made” (Xi-chun’s)
“Ten Thousand Splendors” (Li Wan’s)
“Gathered Auspicious Aura” (Xue Baochai’s)
“A Fairyland Beyond the World” (Lin Daiyu’s)
In short, she praised them all, saying, “Indeed, Sister Baochai and Sister Daiyu’s verses stand out from the rest.” Daiyu, eager to produce more, found the rules only allowed one poem per place. She sighed but complied.

Meanwhile, Baoyu was still composing. He had done three poems for “Xiaoxiang,” “Orchid Mist,” and “Delightful Red,” and was working on “Apricot Banner,” referencing “Green Jade unrolled in spring.” But Baochai glimpsed it and whispered, “Our honored sister disliked your earlier mention of ‘Crimson Fragrance and Emerald Radiance’—why use ‘green jade’ again? We’re to avoid that. Try replacing Jade (yu) with Wax (la).” Baoyu was stumped. She reminded him of a Tang verse by Han Yi: “Chilled candle, no smoke, green wax cold.” Enlightened, Baoyu exclaimed, “Yes, indeed, Sister, you are my best teacher!” She teased in turn, “Better hurry up. Also, you must not call me ‘Sister’—the real Sister is the one robed in gold up there.” Laughing, she slipped away.

Baoyu completed all four. Observing the last line of “Apricot Banner” used “spring onion and orchard—eight lines in total,” he slipped them in with the rest. Daiyu, seeing Baoyu’s mental fatigue, quietly wrote her own alternate poem for that location, crumpled it, and tossed it to him. Baoyu read it and realized it surpassed his lines tenfold, so in fair copy he submitted that. The Imperial Concubine read them, especially praising the “Apricot Banner” poem, ordering them to rename it “Rice-Fragrant Village.” She commanded Tan-chun to transcribe all the verses onto fancy gold-stamped stationery, to present them out front for the elder men to see. Jia Zheng and all extolled them as marvelous. They in turn handed up a “Homecoming Tribute.” The concubine also bestowed rare sweet puddings and golden jellies upon Baoyu and little Jia Lan. For Jia Lan was still a young boy simply accompanying his mother, Li Wan.

During all this, Jia Qiang and the newly-trained girl-actresses waited below, restless. A eunuch suddenly arrived, requesting the scripts. Jia Qiang presented four dramatic pieces: Grand Banquet, Pleading for Skills, Meeting the Celestial and Departing Soul. The eunuchs announced them, and the cast performed with crisp singing and spirited dancing—though mere illusions, they expressed the entire spectrum of sorrow and joy.

When the show ended, an imperial eunuch arrived bearing a golden tray of confections. “Who among you is named Ling-guan?” he asked. Jia Qiang stepped up, realized this was a special gift from the concubine. Overjoyed, he had Ling-guan kneel in thanks. The eunuch next said, “Her Highness requests two more pieces from you; any you wish.” Overstepping, Ling-guan, who specialized in comedic roles, insisted on two comedic scenes instead, ignoring the original plan. Jia Qiang couldn’t sway her, so they did her picks. Yuan-chun laughed from behind the drapes and rewarded her with two bolts of palace satin, embroidered pouches, and gold and silver ingots, telling them, “Do not be too strict with that girl. Instruct her well.”

Then the feast was cleared. The concubine visited yet more corners of the garden. She saw a small Buddhist shrine at the foot of the hill, paused to wash her hands, burned incense, worshiped, and wrote a plaque naming it “Merciful Raft on a Suffering Sea,” granting extra rewards to the novices.

At length a eunuch kneeling reported, “All presentation gifts have been readied; we ask Her Highness to check them so the usual distributions may proceed.” She scanned a short inventory and found no objection, so it was carried out. Grandmother Jia’s portion included a gold and jade ruyi scepter, a rosewood cane set with mother-of-pearl, an agate prayer-bead string, and sets of palace cloth, golden pen rests, silver ingots, with “Long-Life Abundant Spring” inscriptions. Lady Xing and Lady Wang each received half that sum. Jia Jing, Jia She, Jia Zheng got two volumes of newly printed imperial texts, precious ink in two boxes, gold-and-silver cups, and official commemoration items. Bao-chai and Daiyu with the younger sisters each received new volumes, a precious stone seal, gold-silver ingots. Baoyu and Jia Lan got gold and silver necklets and ingots. You-shi, Li Wan, Xi-feng, and others had sets of ingots plus standard textiles. Additionally, two dozen bolts of cloth plus 500 strings of coin were given to Grandmother Jia, Lady Wang, and the younger maids. Jia Zhen, Jia Lian, Jia Huan, Jia Rong, etc. each had one bolt and a pair of ingots. Beyond that, 100 bolts of multi-colored silk, 1,000 taels of silver, and a measure of official wine were bestowed for the entire staff of the Ning and Rong households, plus all who had labored or served in building, carrying, performing, or lighting. Another 300 strings of coin were for the kitchen staff, the performers, the acrobats, and the peddlers.

After all thanked her for this grace, the head eunuch announced, “It’s now around the third quarter of the ‘chǒu’ watch [1–3 a.m.]. The royal palanquin is expected to depart.” Yuan-chun again wept, reluctant to part from her family. She forced a wan smile, clinging to Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang’s hands in farewell, repeating, “Do not overburden your hearts with longing. Cherish yourselves. The imperial kindness is infinite: we can meet once a month if the Emperor permits. If next year’s permission for a homecoming is renewed, let’s be less extravagant.” Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang sobbed so much they could scarcely speak. Yuan-chun, equally grieved, had no choice but to ascend her sedan with the official retinue. The elder women, in tears, had to let her go.

Finally, they managed to calm Grandmother Jia, Lady Wang, and the rest, escorting them from the garden. Thus concluded the great homecoming audience, and so ends this night’s grand ceremony. What befalls them next awaits the subsequent chapter.
CHAPTER 19
Tender Feelings on a Lovely Night as Blossoms Speak;
Endless Affection in a Quiet Day as Jade Exudes Fragrance

When the Imperial Consort (Jia Yuanchun) returned to the palace, the very next day she entered court to express gratitude for the Emperor’s favor regarding her homecoming visit, further reporting on her experience returning to see her parents. The Emperor was greatly pleased and bestowed more treasures from the Imperial Treasury, awarding Jia Zheng and each imperial consort’s family. We need not detail these further.

Meanwhile, in the Rong and Ning mansions, after expending such tremendous effort on the imperial consort’s homecoming and then her departure, everyone felt thoroughly worn out. Day after day they strove to tidy up and store away all the furnishings, ceremonial objects, and utensils used in the garden. Only after two or three days was everything returned to order. The first person feeling the brunt of these labors was Lady Wang (Feng) who bore heavy responsibilities. Others might slip away unnoticed for a break, but she could not. And her nature was so strong-headed, she could never tolerate being judged incompetent or overshadowed. So, she forced herself to keep pace with everyone else, as though she too had no time to rest.

By contrast, Baoyu had the fewest duties, thus the most free time. Yet on this particular morning, Xi-ren’s mother had personally come to Grandmother Jia to request that Xi-ren be allowed to leave for the day—to have tea with her family in celebration of the New Year, returning only at night. Hence Baoyu was left in his room with just the other maids, passing the time playing dice, moving chess pieces, and generally fooling about. They tossed melon seeds everywhere, feeling only half-interested. Suddenly, maids arrived announcing, “Master Zhen from the Eastern Mansion invites you to come watch plays and enjoy lanterns.” Baoyu decided to change clothes and head over. Right at that moment, a eunuch from the palace arrived, delivering a basket of sugar-steamed cream custard bestowed by the Imperial Consort. Baoyu recalled Xi-ren’s fondness for that custard; so, he set some aside for her return and hurried off to Grandmother Jia to announce his going to the East Mansion.

Little did he know that Zhen’s household was staging such performances as Ding Lang Recognizes His Father, Huang Bo’yang’s Grand Display of Netherworld Wraiths, The Monkey King’s Havoc in Heaven, The Investiture of the Gods by Jiang Ziya, and other fantastical plays. Spirits, demons, menacing deities all leapt onstage; cacophonies of banners, chanting, shrill instruments, and drums echoed. Meanwhile, the younger male relatives drank, guessed riddles, circulated wine cups, joked with sisters and their maids. Baoyu, finding the entire scene too loud and rowdy, only lingered a short while before slipping away.

He wandered from courtyard to corridor, stopping first in the inner quarters to chat with Lady You and some maids, dallying a little, then heading out to the second gate. The ladies inside presumed he must have gone back to watch the plays, so no one worried. Jia Zhen, Jia Lian, Xue Pan, and all the others were absorbed in contests of guessing riddles and exchanging toasts, paying no attention to Baoyu’s whereabouts. As for Baoyu’s own junior attendants, those older either snuck off to gamble or gather with friends, knowing that Baoyu’s day out would probably last until evening. The younger ones ran off to watch the theatrics themselves.

Free of notice, Baoyu roamed hither and thither. He recalled, “In that little study here, a painted portrait of a beauty used to hang. Likely in all this bustle, no one is inside. That painted lady must feel lonely. I should pay a comforting visit.” And so, conjuring this whim, he headed to that study. As he neared the window, he suddenly heard heavy breathing inside. Alarmed—“Could it be the painted beauty come to life?”—he gingerly poked through the paper window. Peering in, he saw not a living portrait, but rather his own attendant Mingyan (Ming-yen) pinning down a maid, engaged in that secret act taught by the Fairy of Disenchantment—a moment of stolen passion marked by heated panting.

Baoyu, shocked, exclaimed, “Scandalous!” and kicked the door open. Those two inside were so terrified they began trembling uncontrollably. Mingyan, recognizing Baoyu, immediately knelt in supplication. Baoyu sternly hissed, “Broad daylight—what are you about? If Master Zhen discovers this, you’d be doomed!” He turned to see the young maid, evidently fair-faced and somewhat appealing, crouched in shame, face flushed. Baoyu stamped his foot, “Run away, quickly!” Freed from her shock, the maid dashed out, while Mingyan moaned behind, “Master, that’s as good as telling everything!” Baoyu paused, “And who is that maid? How old is she?” Mingyan said, “Sixteen or seventeen at most.” Baoyu remarked, “You never even asked her age before forcing yourself upon her—what a betrayal of her trust, poor soul!” Then in a softer tone, “What’s her name?” Mingyan smirked, “She claims that when her mother was pregnant, she had a dream of some embroidered brocade bearing endless repeating patterns of the ‘swastika’—so they named her ‘Wan’ (Ten-thousand).” Baoyu let out a laugh, “She must have some special destiny. Well, tomorrow let’s propose she become your wife—wouldn’t that be good?” Mingyan also snickered. Then Baoyu asked, “Now that you’ve had your fun, what next?” Mingyan said, “No one knows we’re here anyway. Let me quietly guide you outside the city for a stroll. We can return later, no one the wiser.” Baoyu shook his head, “That could be dangerous if we’re spotted. Also, if discovered, it’ll be a fiasco. Let’s go somewhere closer, returning soon.” Mingyan pondered, “Close by? Where might we go?” Baoyu brightened, “We’ll see where Hua Big Sister—Xi-ren’s family—lives. Let’s see what she’s doing at home.” Mingyan chirped, “Excellent. But if they find out, they’ll say I encouraged your roaming and punish me severely.” Baoyu promised, “I’ll protect you.”

And so the two left by a rear gate, with no one the wiser, heading down the street. Xi-ren’s family home was not far, less than half a li away. Soon they arrived. Mingyan went first, calling out, “Is Big Bro Hua in?” Xi-ren’s brother, Hua Zifang, seeing it was his lord Baoyu, nearly panicked, but quickly stepped out to greet him and help Baoyu dismount. Inside the courtyard, Xi-ren’s mother and her nieces plus visiting kin were sipping tea. When Xi-ren, who had come home for the day, heard that Baoyu was at the door, she leapt up in a fluster—both happy and anxious—rushing out to ask, “How did you get here?” Baoyu only smiled, “I was bored, so I came to see you.” Xi-ren saw him so relaxed, only shaking her head: “But how can you just wander here? Suppose Master or old Madame find out? They’ll blame us all.” Then she pivoted to scold Mingyan, “Surely you were behind this!” Mingyan retorted, “It was the young master who insisted. Now you put it all on me. If you object, let’s just go back.” Zifang quickly tried to calm them, “All right, all right, the young master’s already arrived—no use fussing. Still, this thatched place is too humble for him to sit.” Xi-ren’s mother also approached, and Xi-ren urged him inside. Observing that it was a cramped interior with maybe three or five other young women present, all shyly dipping their heads, Baoyu was led to a seat. Xi-ren pulled out her own cushion for him, placed her foot warmer at his feet, took her own teacup to serve him. Xi-ren’s mother and brother tried to offer fruits and tea from the household, but Xi-ren intervened: “No need fussing. I know well what the young master can or cannot eat.”

Looking at Xi-ren, Baoyu noticed her eyes slightly red and face pale; he asked softly, “What’s the matter? Why are you crying?” Xi-ren forced a laugh, “I wasn’t crying. Must have rubbed my eyes.” She quickly changed the topic. Xi-ren’s mother and brother, seeing the modest refreshments they possessed, insisted Baoyu sample something. Xi-ren quietly said to him, “You’re here now. You can’t leave empty-handed. At least taste a little. Then you must go.” She peeled some pine-nut kernels and gently blew away the husks, using a handkerchief to offer them. Baoyu saw Xi-ren’s watery, reddened gaze but said no more. She turned to her brother, “Hurry and find a decent, well-shielded carriage so the young master can ride back discreetly. Riding your horse is too conspicuous.” Zifang offered, “I can just escort him on horseback.” Xi-ren insisted, “No, might be recognized in the street. That would cause trouble.” So he hired a carriage. They could not press him to stay longer. Zifang and Mingyan accompanied Baoyu to the door. Xi-ren walked them out, quite worried. Finally Baoyu parted, got in the carriage. Upon reaching the main approach to the Ning Mansion street, Mingyan suggested stopping. “We’d best exit the carriage and get on the horse for the final approach. Then everyone at the East Mansion will suppose we never left.” Zifang agreed. Baoyu dismounted the carriage, hopped on the horse, and trotted back into the Eastern Mansion through a rear gate.

So it was that Baoyu arrived. Meanwhile, in Baoyu’s own quarters, as soon as he had gone, the other maids had seized the chance to amuse themselves freely—dice, card games, scattered melon seeds. Nanny Li (his old nurse) dropped by, wanting to see him, but found only a rowdy group of maids with no sign of Baoyu. The place looked messy. Not at all pleased, she scolded, “Ever since I retired from serving him, you girls have no discipline. The older nurse-maids won’t speak up. That boy has his head turned, ignoring how things are at home. You’re all a disgrace.” Some maids, paying her no regard, resumed playing. Indeed, Li Nanny was no longer officially in charge, so they could dismiss her interference. She had to ask them, “Where’s Baoyu? Has he eaten?” The maids gave half-hearted answers. One maid muttered, “What a nuisance the old bag is.”

Nanny Li spied a bowl of cream custard on the table. “Why not let me eat that?” She lifted it, about to taste. One maid warned: “No, that’s specifically set aside for Xi-ren, so best not touch. Otherwise, you’ll make trouble for us.” Offended, the nanny retorted, “Bah, I can’t believe Baoyu would fuss if I ate a bowl of custard. Even if I consumed something more precious, it’s still warranted—I fed him my milk, raised him to this height. He has no reason to favor Xi-ren over me. Let him recall how he was nursed. Ha! I’ll eat it and see.” Furious, she gulped down the entire bowl. Another maid attempted a gentler approach: “He still respects you. He’s not that petty about trifles. No need to lose temper.” But Nanny Li snapped, “Stop your cunning flattery. I recall that business about tea that got Chai-xue scolded. Another day, if something goes wrong, I’ll do as I please.” With that, she stormed off.

At length Baoyu returned, summoning people to fetch Xi-ren. A maid said, “Xi-ren is probably worn out from her day out, so she’ll come later.” Meanwhile, a bigger maid called Qiu-wen lay in bed, upset from losing at dice once Nanny Li arrived messing about. Baoyu was about to ask further, but Xi-ren arrived. She inquired where Baoyu had dined, asked after the day, and relayed her mother’s and brother’s greetings. Baoyu told her the leftover custard was set aside for her. The maids answered that Nanny Li ate it. Baoyu, hearing this, was about to protest, but Xi-ren calmly broke in, “I had quite enough of that last time. Overeating gave me an upset stomach. Let her have it. She did you no harm.” Changing the subject, Xi-ren said she felt more like having chestnuts now. Baoyu, unsuspecting, believed her. So, sitting at the table, he set about peeling chestnuts.

Observing no one else around, Baoyu teased Xi-ren: “So your red-clad cousin… or was it your aunt’s daughter? She’s quite pretty. Wish we had her here.” Xi-ren, disliking such talk, feigned sarcasm: “So your own personal maid must be a menial, while my kin should become a maid too? Do we all share the same fate?” Baoyu realized her annoyance. He changed the subject. Xi-ren, not truly angry, began to see an opportunity to steer Baoyu toward better conduct.

She sighed as if inadvertently, “I’ve been away from them so long. Soon might I have to go back for good.” Baoyu froze: “Go back? That can’t be!” Xi-ren explained, “You forget I wasn’t originally a house-born bondservant. My family sold me here. Eventually they might want me back. They can pay to redeem me.” Baoyu, stunned, cried, “But if I want you to stay, how could we let them take you?” Xi-ren gently laid out the logic: “Our mansion has never forcibly kept people, especially if they have family. Even if you or Grandmother wanted me, it’s not right to split up a family. Moreover, I’m no rare gem—plenty better maids. Why hamper me? The old madam and Lady Wang wouldn’t do such a thing. That’s bullying. And if forced to remain, how does that help you? Even were they so unkind, I’m not that remarkable to deserve it.”

Baoyu grew more anxious. “So you insist on leaving?!” Xi-ren calmly repeated her argument. Finally Baoyu concluded, “So all along, you treat me so kindly, but truly are heartless. Suppose you do depart, leaving me alone a lost ghost—why did you come to me at all?” Xi-ren realized this boy was overwrought again. She needed to quell his anxieties. So she changed her approach, saying, “All right, if truly you want me to stay, you can prove it. In fact, there are three specific ways. If you promise them wholeheartedly, I’ll never leave, not even if they put a knife to my throat.” Eagerly, Baoyu said, “Name them! I vow to do them! A thousand tasks wouldn’t matter—only let me be with you always, until the day I dissolve into smoke.” Xi-ren covered his mouth, “Hush that talk. The first condition: no more saying you’re worthless, or longing to die, or wanting to vanish into thin air. Enough gloom.” Baoyu nodded, “Yes, yes, never again. And the second?” Xi-ren said, “When your father or older men mention studying, or see you, you must not bad-mouth reading. Pretend you want to read. Don’t be spouting nonsense about how beyond ‘illuminating virtue’ no text is real, or calling scholars ‘fortune-mites.’ That outrages your father, spurring him to beat you. He’s from a lineage of scholars, so hearing you scorn them daily is maddening. So promise me.” Baoyu said, “All right, I’ll say no more.” Xi-ren added, “Third, do not belittle monks or Daoists. And also, end this fetish for smearing your face with rouge, nibbling the lip-paste from a maid’s mouth, or drooling after anything red. Stop that. Then I can stay.”

Baoyu promptly agreed: “All done, all done. If there’s more, say it now.” Xi-ren laughed, “No more. Just conduct yourself with decency. Then you show sincerity in wanting me here. I’ll stay even if my mother begs me to go.” Baoyu’s heart soared. He teased: “You’ll stay forever, so maybe one day you’ll get a grand eight-man sedan.” Xi-ren grimaced, “Pah, what is that to me? If I had such fortune, it’d be pointless. Enough.”

They concluded, chatting about other trifles. In the late hours, around three in the morning, Xi-ren felt unwell and sank into bed, her body hot and head pounding. A doctor arrived, diagnosing a mild wind-cold. He prescribed a warming decoction. She took one or two doses and lay swaddled to sweat it off. Baoyu, seeing her so ill, decided to keep her company. Later in the day, he wandered to Daiyu’s room, hoping for conversation.

He found Daiyu also napping. The maids stepped out for errands. She was alone, dozing behind a soft gauze bed curtain. Baoyu gently lifted the curtain. “Cousin, you just had lunch—why more sleep?” Daiyu stirred, half awake: “I’m tired from being up too long last night. Let me rest.” Baoyu coaxed her: “Napping too much can cause illness. Let me amuse you so you won’t oversleep.” Daiyu turned away: “I’m not so drowsy, just need a quiet moment. Could you go somewhere else?” Baoyu insisted, “Where would I go? Others annoy me. I’ll stay with you.” She retorted, “Fine, but keep quiet so I can rest.” Baoyu teased, “Then let me lie down, too.” “Use your own pillow,” she said. “No, we’ll share one,” he replied. “Nonsense, the outer room has pillows.” Baoyu scouted outside: “I see a pillow, but it might belong to some sweaty maid.” Daiyu, forced to respond, half-smiling, lifted her pillow. “Take this one. I’ll fetch another.” So they lay facing each other.

Examining Baoyu up close, Daiyu noticed a spot on his cheek about the size of a button. “Did some sharp fingernail scratch you?” she asked. Baoyu tried to downplay it: “Perhaps just a dab of rouge from mixing someone’s lip-paste. Let me wipe it off.” Daiyu took her own handkerchief and rubbed it away. Then she scolded him: “You’ve been at your old mischief again, messing with that red stuff. If father sees, we’ll all be in trouble.” Baoyu only inhaled a faint fragrance from her sleeve. Overcome, he exclaimed: “What do you keep hidden in your sleeve that smells so good?” Daiyu teased, “I keep no sachets or perfume—maybe the closet’s incense cling is leftover.” Baoyu shook his head, “That can’t be. The scent is quite special, not any standard sachet.” Daiyu laughed: “What, do you suspect some miracle from a wandering monk or immortal gave me special incense? I’m no such marvel. Anyway, if I had it, you’d want to fuse it with your own ‘red fragrance’ fetish. Enough.” Baoyu retorted with mock severity, “You’re asking for trouble!” He reached out, tickling her. Daiyu shrieked with laughter, “Stop, or I’ll be upset!” Baoyu let go.

They resumed lying quietly. He chatted about random nonsense. Daiyu, half ignoring him, turned her face away. Baoyu kept prattling, she said nothing. So he changed topics, asking about her journey from Yangzhou: “What was it like? Did you see any interesting sights or local traditions?” She declined to elaborate, presumably dozing. So Baoyu tried to amuse her with a silly story: “In Yangzhou’s yamen, a great event took place. Let me share it.” Daiyu stirred: “What event?” Baoyu spun a fable about a local mountain called “Dai Mountain” with a “Linzi Grotto,” inhabited by demon rats planning to steal Laba Festival grains, but one cunning small rat changed shape into ‘Xiangyu’—linguistically punning her name. Daiyu realized he was mockingly referring to her as “Fragrant Jade.” Furious yet laughing, she pinned him down, calling, “You foul mouth!” He surrendered, apologizing: “No more such jokes. It’s just an old story.” Daiyu declared, “Is that a real old story or made up?” Baoyu grinned: “Truly an old story.” She teased, “Well, you’ve vented your insults. Let that suffice.” He tried to tickle her again. She squealed, “Mercy, cousin. All right, let’s not continue.”

At that moment, Xue Baochai came by, asking: “What ‘old story’ is that? Let me hear.” Daiyu said, “He calls it an old story, but it’s just slander.” Baochai laughed: “Ah, if it’s from Baoyu, it’s inevitably nonsense. Surprising though, some nights he can’t recall the simplest reference. Then out of nowhere, he spouts entire made-up lines. Must be random.” Daiyu giggled: “Yes, indeed. The other night, facing that banana-leaf poem, he forgot the ‘Han Yi line’ you reminded him of. One moment his mind is blank, the next it’s overfull. Baffling.” Baoyu frowned, “You’re both ganging up on me.” He was about to retort but got cut off by a sudden uproar from his own room.

And thus ends this chapter.
CHAPTER 20
Wang Xifeng Righteously Rebukes Jealousy
Lin Daiyu’s Witty Words Tease with Tender Sounds

When Baoyu was in Daiyu’s room joking about “mouse spirits,” Xue Baochai happened to arrive, lightly mocking him for not knowing the allusion to “green wax” in the Lantern Festival tradition. So, the three of them laughed and chatted in Daiyu’s quarters. Because Baoyu was worried that, having just eaten, Daiyu might doze off, nap too long, and harm her health—yet with Baochai there, Daiyu was kept amused, so she wouldn't immediately feel sleepy. It relieved Baoyu somewhat. But just then, they heard an uproar coming from Baoyu’s own rooms. The group listened and heard Daiyu laugh first, saying, “That’s your mother and Xiren arguing, isn’t it? Though Xiren usually treats her so well, now your mama is really picking on her. She’s evidently in a sour mood.”

Baoyu wanted to rush over, but Baochai grabbed him and said, “Don’t go bickering with your mama. She’s an elderly person, a bit muddled sometimes. It’ll do no good to quarrel. Just yield a little.”

Baoyu replied, “I understand,” and departed.

He arrived to see Li Granny (Granny Li), leaning on her walking stick, scolding Xiren:

“You ungrateful little hussy! I was the one who raised you, yet now when I come, you lie there on the kang, not paying me any respect. All you do is seduce Baoyu with your foxy charms, tricking him so he ignores me and only listens to you. You’re no more than a cheap maid bought for a few coins, and you strut around this room like you own it! If this is your attitude, I’ll have you dragged outside and married off to some petty fellow, so we’ll see if you can still enchant men like some demon!”
Originally, Xiren thought Li Granny was merely upset because she saw her lying down. She calmly explained, “I’m ill, feverish, and just covered my head; I truly did not see you, Grannie.” But when she heard the insinuations about “bewitching Baoyu” and “marrying her off,” she could not hold back her shame and grievances. She began to weep. Baoyu, though hearing everything, found it hard to intervene. He kept saying, “She’s unwell, took medicine,” or, “If you don’t believe me, ask one of the other maids.”

But Li Granny got even angrier at that:

“You just protect these vixens and no longer recognize me. If I asked anyone here, they’d all side with you. Isn’t it that none of them but Xiren controls the rest, and I know all about it! Let me go talk to the Old Lady and Madam Wang; I’ll tell them how I nursed you all these years, and now that you don’t need my milk you throw me aside, letting these girls boss me around!”
She spoke, tears falling. At that moment, Lin Daiyu and Xue Baochai arrived to try and calm things:

“Granny, you’re older; please go easy on them,” they pleaded.
But Li Granny, spotting them, poured out more complaints, repeating her old grievances about that day someone served her tea, about Chixue, and about the previous day’s sweet cream fiasco, going on and on.

Just then, Wang Xifeng, having been tallying up gambling losses in the main quarters, heard the commotion. She realized Li Granny was once again throwing a tantrum—likely exasperated after losing money herself, she was venting that frustration at Baoyu’s maids. Xifeng rushed over and gently took Li Granny by the arm, saying with a smile:

“Granny, don’t be angry. It’s the festive season, and just yesterday the Old Lady was delighted. You’re the senior here; you should be the one to stop others from quarreling. How could you yourself stir up a big scene and upset the Old Lady? If you think someone’s done wrong, just tell me. I’ll punish them for you. I’ve got a roast pheasant, steaming hot—come drink some wine with me.”
She spoke as she pulled her away, calling:

“Fenger, come fetch her walking stick and handkerchief for her tears!”
With that, Li Granny was practically carried away, still yelling, “I don’t care if I lose face—I’ll make a scene right now, better than taking this wretched girl’s insults!”

Back in the room, Baoyu and Daiyu merely laughed and clapped:

“That whirlwind of Sister-in-law Xifeng came by and just whisked the old biddy away,” they chuckled.
Baoyu sighed:

“I wonder who she’s really upset with. She only dares pick on the soft-hearted folk. Probably someone else offended her, and she’s taking it out on Xiren.”
He didn’t finish the sentence when Qingwen, standing nearby, interjected:

“Hmph, as if we’ve gone mad enough to cross her. And if someone did cross her, they’ve got the courage to handle it themselves—no need to drag the rest of us down!”
Meanwhile, Xiren sobbed, tugging Baoyu’s sleeve:

“Because of me you’ve vexed your old nurse. Now you’re also offending everyone else for my sake. Isn’t that more than enough trouble for me? And I’m only making more entanglements!”
Seeing Xiren’s feverish complexion, Baoyu realized that all this fighting was only increasing her distress. So he swallowed his anger, reassuring her:

“Try to rest again, don’t worry about them.”
Xiren, letting out a bitter smile, responded:

“If any of us got upset by all this, we could not last an hour here. This chaos never ends—how can one live? Sure, in the moment you stand up for me, but they’ll remember it. Next time a problem arises, you’ll hear all sorts of nasty talk. What’s the point?”
Tears welled again, but she tried to restrain them so Baoyu wouldn’t fret.

After a while, a servant woman brought in medicine. Seeing Xiren sweating a bit, Baoyu told her to remain in bed. He personally helped her drink the medicine, then asked the maids to prepare the bedding.

Xiren said:

“Aren’t you going to eat something? Please go sit a while with the Old Lady or the Madam, or chat with the girls, then come back. Let me rest quietly.”
Baoyu nodded and complied, waiting until her hair ornaments were removed and she lay down comfortably. Then he hurried to the main quarters and joined Grandmother Jia for dinner.

When dinner ended, Grandmother Jia wanted to continue playing with some old stewardess-women, gambling at cards. Baoyu, worrying about Xiren, soon excused himself and returned to his room. There he found Xiren asleep, and he, feeling drowsy but seeing it was still early, decided to doze.

Qingwen, Qixia, Qiuwen, Bihe, all had gone off to find lively fun with Yuan Yang, Hupo, and so on. Only Mushe (Miaoyue? – though apparently “Miaoyue” might be “Miaoyue” in a previous context, here we see the name as “Miaoyue or Muskmoon. The text says “见麝月一人在外间” which is “Musk Moon alone in the outer room.”) was left in the outer room, carefully recording a set of dominoes in a ledger. Baoyu teased:

“Why not join them?”
She replied:

“I have no money to gamble.”
Baoyu laughed:

“No money? Don’t we have a trunk full of it somewhere?”
Muskmoon (麝月) answered:

“They’re all having fun. But who’ll watch the house? Xiren’s ill, the lamps overhead are lit, the stoves beneath are burning, the older servant women have toiled since dawn—they deserve a rest, and the young maids have also worked all day, so let them have a bit of fun. That’s why I’m staying here to keep watch.”
Hearing this, Baoyu was pleased. She seemed so conscientious, just like Xiren. He said:

“All right, I can keep watch with you, so you go amuse yourself.”
She responded:

“No need. If you’re here with me, that’s even better. Let’s just chat.”
Baoyu said:

“But how to pass the time just the two of us? That’s no fun. Wait, earlier you said your scalp itched; I’m free now—how about I comb your hair?”
Muskmoon replied:

“Good idea,”
and brought out a mirror, hair ornaments, letting him take a comb. Baoyu gently combed through her hair.

He’d only done a few strokes when Qingwen stormed in to fetch some money. Seeing them, she sneered:

“My, you haven’t even exchanged wine cups, yet you’re already tending each other’s hair? Quite a scene!”
Baoyu, smiling, said:

“Come here, I can comb yours, too!”
She retorted:

“I haven’t that kind of luck,”
and marched out, letting the curtain fall with a thump. Baoyu and Muskmoon looked at each other in the mirror, exchanging a smile. Baoyu said quietly:

“She’s the real trouble in this house.”
Muskmoon quickly made a gesture in the mirror, telling him to hush. The next moment, the curtain flew up again; Qingwen reappeared, demanding:

“How am I causing trouble? Let’s hear it!”
Muskmoon, half-laughing, replied:

“Go about your business. Don’t start another quarrel.”
Qingwen also laughed:

“Oh, you’re shielding him? You think I don’t know your little secrets? Just wait, I’ll get my own revenge.”
Then she turned and left. Baoyu finished combing, and asked Muskmoon to quietly help him settle in bed. He didn’t want to disturb Xiren. Thus the night passed.

Next morning, Xiren, having sweated through the night, felt somewhat better and only took some rice gruel. Baoyu, seeing her improved, was at ease. After breakfast, he strolled to Aunt Xue’s quarters.

It was still the first lunar month, so the family school was on holiday. Embroidery was considered taboo in these festival days, so the ladies were idle. Thus even Jia Huan (aka “Huan”) had come to amuse himself. He found Xue Baochai, Xiangling, and Ying’er (Baochai’s maid) playing with dice or dominos. He wanted to join them. Baochai, who usually regarded him as kindly as Baoyu, invited him to sit. They wagered ten coins a round. At first, Huan won and was quite happy. But soon, he lost several times in a row. He grew anxious. In this crucial roll, if he got a 7 or 6, he’d win, but if 3, he’d lose. He threw the dice vigorously. One die stopped at 2, while the other spun. Ying’er clapped:

“It’s a 1—‘One’ (么)!”
But Huan, glaring, insisted:

“Six! Seven! Eight!”
He tried to cheat, snatching up the dice, claiming it was a 4. Ying’er said:

“Clearly it was a 1!”
Baochai, seeing how worked up he was, shot Ying’er a warning glance:

“Don’t talk back so rudely! How could a young master cheat? Put your money down.”
But Ying’er, feeling wronged, had to comply and set the money on the table, muttering:

“He’s a ‘master,’ sure, but he’s cheating out of a few coins. He must think so little of me! When Baoyu played with us before, he lost a lot, but never minded. He even let the little maids snatch the last of his coins, only laughing it off.”
Baochai cut her off, scolding her softly. Huan exclaimed:

“How can I compare with Baoyu? You all fear him, so you side with him, ganging up on me because I’m not the main wife’s son!”
And with that, he began to weep. Baochai hastened to soothe him:

“Dear little brother, please don’t talk so. People will laugh,”
and admonished Ying’er for provoking.

At that moment, Baoyu arrived. Seeing the situation, he asked:

“What’s going on?”
Huan dared not respond. Baochai, suspecting Baoyu might scold him, quickly concealed the matter. Baoyu simply said:

“It’s still the holiday, no need for tears. If you don’t like playing here, you can find another place. You study every day but only confuse yourself. Imagine something you own is flawed—just discard it and pick a better one. Why cling to a disliked toy, crying over it? It’s meant to amuse you, but you’re only making yourself miserable. Why not be done and go?”
Huan had no choice but to leave. At home, his mother, Zhao, asked:

“What’s vexed you?”
He told her about Baochai, Ying’er, how he lost, how Baoyu told him to go away. Zhao spat:

“Why go ‘courting trouble on the high stage’? You worthless brat—there are a thousand places to have fun, why choose the one that humiliates you?”
She was still berating him when, by chance, Wang Xifeng passed outside the window. She overheard and called in:

“It’s just after New Year’s—why all this fuss? Children sometimes misbehave. That’s for the Old Master and Mistress to correct. There’s no cause for you to rant. He is a young master, after all. If there’s something wrong, the family’s elders will see to it. Since when do you get to scold him as if spitting seeds? Huan, come out with me and play.”
Because Huan feared Xifeng more than Wang-Fu, he obeyed, leaving Zhao speechless. Xifeng gently said:

“Huan, you’re hopeless! I’ve often told you—whatever you want, just get it. Whichever sister, brother, or cousin you like to play with is fine. But you never listen. Now you end up letting others twist your mind, stirring up resentful thoughts. You act no better than a common scoundrel, then blame others for partiality. All this over losing a few coins! By the way, how much did you lose?”
Huan mumbled:

“A hundred or two.”
Xifeng scoffed:

“You call yourself a young master? Making such a scene over a couple hundred coins?”
Then she turned, calling:

“Fenger, fetch him a string of cash so he can play with the girls. Next time you get so petty, I’ll thrash you myself, then tell the school—maybe they’ll strip the skin off you. You unworthy boy, your brother’s itching to thrash you; if not for my protection, he’d have stomped your guts out. Now off you go.”
Huan, receiving the money, hurried away to join Yingchun and the other girls.

Meanwhile, Baoyu stayed with Baochai in idle banter. Suddenly, someone announced, “Miss Shi (Shi Dagu) has arrived.” Baoyu immediately sprang up to greet. Baochai teased:

“Wait, let’s go together. I want to see how you greet her.”
They left for Grandmother Jia’s quarters. Sure enough, Shi Xiangyun was there, lively and chatty. Seeing Baochai and Baoyu, Xiangyun quickly stood and greeted them. Lin Daiyu was present too, so she asked Baoyu:

“Where did you come from now?”
Baoyu said:

“From Sister Bao’s place.”
Daiyu sneered:

“I knew it. If not for something hindering you, you’d have flown there sooner.”
Baoyu replied:

“So I can only be allowed to amuse you and keep you company. If by chance I go chat with her, you throw these remarks at me.”
Daiyu retorted:

“How pointless—where you go is none of my concern. I never told you to keep me company! You might as well never come back.”
Then she stomped away in a huff.

Baoyu hastily followed, asking:

“Why so upset out of nowhere? Even if I said something wrong, you could at least have sat a while with the others, laugh and talk—why storm off?”
Daiyu muttered:

“Why should you care?”
Baoyu grinned:

“I wouldn’t dare meddle, but you’re only harming your own health with this negativity.”
Daiyu answered:

“I can ruin my own health. If I die, so what? It’s no concern of yours.”
Baoyu said:

“Why so extreme, talking of death right after the festival?”
She said:

“Yes, I’ll speak of death. I’ll die this minute. Are you terrified, wanting me to live forever?”
Baoyu laughed:

“If you carry on like this, I’m not afraid of death at all. Might as well die quickly.”
Daiyu shot back:

“Indeed, better I die too, than keep fussing like this!”
Baoyu objected:

“I said I'd kill myself, not you. Don’t twist my words and blame me.”
They stood there bickering. Baochai appeared:

“Young Miss Shi is waiting for you two,”
and, pulling Baoyu by the arm, led him away. Daiyu, even more vexed, stood alone at the window, tears brimming.

After a bit, Baoyu sneaked back. Seeing Daiyu still weeping, he tried every warm phrase to console her, but before he could speak, Daiyu said:

“Why come back again? Whether I live or die, let me be. You already have someone else to amuse you—someone who can read, can write, can joke, can coax you sweetly so you never get annoyed. Why come bother me?”
Baoyu stepped forward softly:

“You are bright; do you not understand the saying, ‘No closeness is shattered by any lesser tie. No younger can usurp the older’s place’? However silly I am, I grasp that principle. We two are maternal cousins, but Sister Bao is paternal. By blood she’s further. You arrived here first, from childhood you and I ate at the same table, slept in the same bed. She only arrived recently. Why would I choose her over you?”
Daiyu spat:

“I never told you to ignore her. What kind of person would that make me? I’m only upset about how I feel inside!”
Baoyu responded:

“I also do it for what I feel inside. Don’t you know my heart as I know yours?”
At that, Daiyu fell silent. After a moment, she said:

“You blame others for scolding or giving you trouble, but you cannot fathom how you’re hurting me. Look at today’s weather. It’s clearly chilly, so why did you remove your turquoise fur cloak?”
Baoyu smiled:

“I was still wearing it. But you got angry, so I got all hot and took it off.”
Daiyu sighed:

“You’ll catch cold, and again you’ll fuss for treats to cure it.”
As they spoke, Xiangyun came, laughing:

“Dear ‘Ai’ Brother, dear Lin Sister, you two spend every day together, and now that I finally came, you ignore me?”
Daiyu teased:

“You do love to twist your tongue. You can’t even say ‘Er’ (Second) Brother, you keep calling him ‘Ai’ Brother, ‘Ai’ Brother. Wait until we play dice, you’ll start with ‘Mo Ai San!’”
Baoyu joked:

“You’re used to it. Soon you’ll be biting your own tongue!”
Xiangyun giggled:

“She never lets anyone off. Maybe you’re good, but that doesn’t justify teasing everyone. I’ll point out a person. Dare you mock them? Then I’ll concede you’re top of the pack.”
Daiyu asked:

“Who is it?”
Xiangyun said:

“Try picking at Sister Bao’s flaws, and I’ll accept your wit.”
Daiyu gave a cold laugh:

“Oh, it’s her. I don’t dare slight her at all!”
Baoyu quickly changed the subject. Xiangyun laughed:

“I can’t compare with you in skill. I only hope one day you’ll find a husband who also slurs his words, so you’ll endure ‘Ai, ah, e…’ all day. Then, aha, I’ll finally see something to amuse me!”
Baoyu joined in a laugh, and Xiangyun fled, leaving Daiyu and Baoyu behind.
Chapter 21

Xian Xi Ren playfully scolds Baoyu; Charming Ping’er softly pleads for Jia Lian.

After Shi Xiangyun said her piece and burst out laughing, she ran outside to avoid Lin Daiyu catching up with her. Baoyu followed quickly, calling out, "Watch out you don’t trip! You’re not going to catch her that quickly!" When Daiyu reached the doorway, Baoyu spread his arms against the frame, blocking her path, and laughed, "Let her go just this once." Daiyu, holding his hand, replied, "If I let Yun’er off the hook, I might as well not live." Seeing that Baoyu was blocking the door and Daiyu wouldn’t be able to get through, Xiangyun stopped in her tracks and laughed, "Good sister, please let me go just this once!" Just then, Xue Baochai approached from behind Xiangyun, also laughing. "I’d advise you two to let go of each other out of respect for Brother Bao," she said. Daiyu retorted, "I won’t. You’re all in cahoots, just ganging up to tease me." Baoyu tried to soothe her, "Oh, come on. Who would dare tease you? If you didn’t tease her first, she wouldn’t even think of teasing you."

While the four of them were still at an impasse, someone came to summon them for dinner. They made their way to the front hall. By then, the lamps had been lit. Wang Xifeng, Li Wan, Wang Xifeng’s sister-in-laws Yingchun, Tanchun, and Xichun had all gathered at the Lady Dowager’s quarters. They chatted for a while before everyone retired to their own rooms. Xiangyun again chose to stay in Daiyu’s room for the night.

Baoyu escorted the two girls back to their quarters, but it was already late in the night. Only after being urged by Xi Ren several times did he finally return to his own room. The next morning, at first light, he threw on some clothes and shoes and went over to Daiyu’s room, only to find that Zijuan and Cuilu were not there. The two sisters were still in bed, each under their respective covers—Daiyu snugly wrapped in a red silk quilt, sleeping peacefully, while Xiangyun’s hair flowed down by her pillow. Her peach-pink quilt barely reached her chest, revealing her fair arms adorned with golden bracelets.

Seeing this, Baoyu exclaimed, "You still sleep so restlessly! Later, the wind will chill you again, and then you’ll be complaining about sore shoulders." As he spoke, he gently adjusted her blanket. Daiyu, already awake, sensed someone in the room. She guessed it was Baoyu, turned over, and sure enough, it was him. "What are you doing here so early?" she asked. Baoyu replied, "Early? You should get up and see for yourself." Daiyu said, "You go outside and let us get up first." So Baoyu stepped into the outer room. Daiyu got up and woke Xiangyun, and the two of them dressed. When Baoyu came back in, he sat by the dressing table. Soon, Zijuan and Cuilu came in to help them wash and dress. After washing her face, Xiangyun handed her remaining water to Cuilu, who was about to pour it away. Baoyu said, "Hold on, I might as well wash up here too. No need to go elsewhere and make a fuss." With that, he stepped forward, bent over, and washed his face. When Zijuan handed him a bar of fragrant soap, Baoyu said, "No need for that. There’s plenty left in the basin." He washed his face again and asked for a towel. Cuilu smirked, "Still up to your old tricks." Baoyu ignored her, quickly wiped his face, scrubbed his teeth with a bit of salt, and rinsed his mouth. By this time, Xiangyun had finished styling her hair, and Baoyu came over, jokingly asking, "Good sister, could you braid my hair?" Xiangyun laughed, "I can’t do that." Baoyu teased, "Oh, but you used to braid it for me before!" Xiangyun replied, "I’ve forgotten how to now." Baoyu pleaded, "I’m not going out today. Just a couple of simple braids will do." With that, he kept calling her "sister" this and "sister" that, until she finally gave in and started braiding his hair.

Baoyu’s usual hairstyle at home consisted of several short braids gathered into one large braid at the top, fastened with a red ribbon. From the crown to the end of the braid, he wore four pearls, and at the tip, a golden ornament dangled. As Xiangyun braided his hair, she noticed, "There are only three pearls left. One is missing. I remember they were all the same. Where’s the fourth one?" Baoyu replied, "It’s lost." Xiangyun guessed, "It must’ve fallen off while you were outside. Someone must have picked it up and kept it. Lucky for them!" Daiyu, overhearing, chuckled and said, "Who knows if it’s really lost? Maybe you gave it to someone to mount on a hairpin!" Baoyu said nothing and began to fiddle with some items on the vanity. He picked up a box of rouge and seemed about to take it away but hesitated, fearing Xiangyun would notice. As he hesitated, Xiangyun reached from behind and slapped the rouge out of his hand, scolding, "Still up to these bad habits! When will you ever change?"

At that moment, Xi Ren entered. Seeing that the group had already freshened up, she left again to wash herself. Soon, Baochai came over and asked, "Where’s Brother Bao?" Xi Ren replied sarcastically, "Does ‘Brother Bao’ ever have time to stay home?" Hearing this, Baochai understood and sat down. In their casual conversation, she subtly inquired about Xi Ren’s background and observed her demeanor. Xi Ren’s words and actions impressed Baochai, making her think, "I underestimated this maid. Her speech reveals wisdom and insight."

Shortly after, Baoyu came in, and Baochai left. Baoyu asked Xi Ren, "Why did Baochai leave as soon as I arrived?" Xi Ren didn’t reply at first, but when Baoyu repeated his question, she finally said, "Why are you asking me? I have no idea what’s going on between you two." Baoyu, noticing her unusual tone and expression, laughed and asked, "What’s made you upset?" Xi Ren smirked, "Me? Upset? How could I dare? Just don’t come into this room anymore. You have plenty of others to serve you, so there’s no need to bother me. I’ll go back to attending the Old Lady instead." With that, she lay down on the kang and closed her eyes. Baoyu, taken aback, anxiously pleaded with her, but she kept her eyes shut and ignored him. Out of options, Baoyu turned to Sheyue and asked, "What’s wrong with her?" Sheyue replied, "How should I know? Why don’t you figure it out yourself?" Feeling lost, Baoyu muttered, "If she won’t speak to me, then fine—I’ll go take a nap." With that, he lay down on his bed.

Hearing that Baoyu was quiet for a while, Xi Ren assumed he had fallen asleep. She got up and draped a cloak over him. Baoyu suddenly flipped it off and pretended to remain asleep. Realizing his ploy, Xi Ren shook her head and said, "You don’t need to be upset. From now on, I’ll just keep silent and never say a word to you again—how’s that?" Baoyu couldn’t help but ask, "What did I do wrong? You didn’t even say anything before going to bed, so how am I supposed to know? Now you’re saying I’m upset, but I didn’t even hear what you were trying to tell me." Xi Ren replied, "You really don’t know? You’re still waiting for me to spell it out?"

Just then, a servant came to summon Baoyu for breakfast. After hastily finishing his meal, he returned to his room. He saw Xi Ren lying on the outer kang, with Sheyue playing cards nearby. Knowing how close the two were, Baoyu didn’t speak to either of them. Instead, he lifted the curtain and went into his inner chamber. Sheyue followed him inside, but Baoyu motioned her out, saying, "I don’t dare trouble you." Sheyue smiled and left, sending in two younger maids instead. Baoyu, engrossed in a book, eventually asked for tea. Looking up, he asked the slightly older, more refined maid, "Isn’t your name ‘Xiang’ something?" She replied, "I’m Hui Xiang." Baoyu asked, "Who gave you that name?" She replied, "I was originally called Yun Xiang, but Sister Hua renamed me." Baoyu commented, "You might as well be called ‘Unlucky’—all this ‘Hui Xiang’ talk is meaningless! From now on, just call yourself ‘Four.’ No need for all these fancy flower names." As he spoke, he told her to pour him tea. Xi Ren and Sheyue, listening from the outer room, stifled their laughter.

That day, Baoyu stayed in his room, listless and pensive. He tried to distract himself by reading or playing with his calligraphy tools. He didn’t summon any of the other servants, relying solely on “Four.” But the clever maid quickly adapted, doing her best to please him. In the evening, after having a few drinks, Baoyu found himself alone by the lamp. In the past, Xi Ren and the others would joke and chat with him, but now the room felt cold and quiet. He considered calling them back but hesitated, fearing they’d hold it over him later. He also felt it too unkind to play the strict master. Finally, he decided, "I’ll just pretend they’re all gone. I’ll manage on my own." With that thought, he felt a strange calm, as if he had cast off his worries.

Baoyu asked Four to trim the wick and prepare some tea. He picked up a copy of the Zhuangzi and read until he reached the chapter on "The Lost Cord." The text said:

Thus, if we discard wisdom and abandon cunning, great thieves will cease. When jade is discarded and pearls are broken, petty theft will no longer arise. Burn the seals and break the tokens, and the people will become simple and honest. Destroy the scales and break the measures, and the people will cease to dispute. When all laws and regulations are obliterated, then the people can engage in true discussion. When the six tones are disrupted and the lutes are silenced, the blind will finally hear with their hearts. When literature is abolished and colors are banished, the eyes of the blind will finally perceive clearly. When we destroy the compass and the square, and abandon the rules, the skilled will finally reveal their natural abilities.

Inspired, Baoyu continued the passage in his own hand:

Burning the flowers and scattering the musk, the women of the inner chambers can finally find their true worth. Destroying the divine grace of their jade bracelets, the ethereal wisdom of their brows, and all heavenly sentiments, the beauty and flaws of the women in the inner chambers will finally become apparent. Once they find their true worth, there will be no more discord. By destroying their divine grace, they will have no romantic inclinations. By erasing their ethereal wisdom, they will have no creative impulses. Those who entangle the world with their charms—Baoyu, Daiyu, Baochai, and their fragrant adornments—are but nets and snares that deceive and trap the people.

When he finished writing, Baoyu set down his brush and lay down. As soon as his head touched the pillow, he fell into a deep sleep, not waking until dawn.

Upon waking, he turned over and saw Xi Ren lying fully clothed on top of the blanket. Forgetting the previous day’s quarrel, he nudged her and said, "Get under the covers, or you’ll catch a chill." Xi Ren, seeing that Baoyu seemed to have softened, decided to remain distant. She didn’t respond to his nudging. Baoyu took it further, trying to undo her buttons to make her more comfortable, but she pushed his hands away and refastened them herself. Frustrated, Baoyu held her hand and asked with a laugh, "What’s wrong with you now?" After several repeated questions, Xi Ren finally opened her eyes and said, "What’s the matter with me? You’re awake now, so get up and wash. If you wait any longer, you’ll miss breakfast." Baoyu asked, "Where should I go?" Xi Ren replied coldly, "How would I know? Go wherever you like. From now on, we’ll keep our distance. No more arguments, no more gossip, no more giving people a reason to laugh. Since you’ve got maids like Four and Five waiting on you, we ‘lowly things’ are just a disgrace to our fine names." Baoyu laughed, "You’re still holding on to that?" Xi Ren said, "I’ll hold on to it for a hundred years if I must. Unlike you, I won’t forget a promise made at night by the next morning." Seeing her pouting, Baoyu couldn’t help himself. He picked up a jade hairpin, snapped it in half, and declared, "If I don’t listen to you anymore, I’ll end up like this hairpin!" Startled, Xi Ren picked up the pieces and scolded, "What’s the point of doing that? Whether you listen to me or not is up to you. There’s no need to go to such extremes." Baoyu replied, "You don’t understand how worried I feel." Xi Ren smiled and said, "Oh, you know how to worry? Do you have any idea how I feel? Now hurry up and wash." At last, they both got up and began their morning routines.

After Baoyu left for the main hall, Lin Daiyu happened to come by. Finding that Baoyu wasn’t there, she casually leafed through the books on his desk and stumbled upon his copy of Zhuangzi. When she saw the continuation he had written, she laughed and fumed at the same time. Picking up a brush, she wrote a quatrain:

Who on earth takes up the brush so lightly? Mimicking the words of Zhuangzi’s lore, Unrepentant of his own ignorance, Yet mocking others in his scornful scrawl.

After adding her lines, Daiyu also made her way to the main hall to see the Lady Dowager and later visited Lady Wang.
Chapter 22
Baoyu Gains Buddhist Insight from an Opera; Jia Zheng Finds an Ominous Message in a Lantern Riddle

Jia Lian, upon hearing that Wang Xifeng wanted to discuss something with him, stopped and asked, "What is it?"

Xifeng said, "The twenty-first is Cousin Xue's birthday. What do you plan to do?"

Jia Lian responded, "What do I need to do? You’ve handled countless birthdays before, and now you’re suddenly out of ideas?"

Xifeng explained, "For grand birthdays, we follow established customs. But for her, it's neither a big celebration nor a minor one, so I wanted to discuss it with you."

Jia Lian thought for a moment and said, "You’re overcomplicating things. There's already a precedent—Lin Daiyu. However, we celebrated her birthday before. Just follow the same arrangement for Xue Baochai."

Xifeng smirked, "Of course, I know that. But yesterday, Old Madam Jia was asking about everyone's birthdays and mentioned that Cousin Xue is turning fifteen this year. Though it’s not a major milestone, it's close to her coming-of-age ceremony. Since Old Madam Jia wants to celebrate, naturally, it won’t be the same as how we did for Lin Daiyu before."

Jia Lian said, "Then just make it a bit grander than Lin Daiyu’s celebration."

Xifeng replied, "That’s exactly what I was thinking. But I wanted to check with you first. If I went ahead and added more on my own, you’d accuse me of making decisions without consulting you."

Jia Lian laughed, "Fine, fine! I won’t take credit for it. Just don't fleece me for more money, and I won’t complain." Saying this, he left.

Preparations for Baochai’s Birthday
Meanwhile, Shi Xiangyun had been staying in the Jia household for two days and planned to leave. However, Old Madam Jia persuaded her, "Stay until after Baochai’s birthday and watch the opera before going home."

Xiangyun agreed and sent someone back to retrieve two pieces of needlework she had previously made, intending to gift them to Baochai.

Since Baochai had only recently arrived at the mansion, this was her first birthday celebration with the Jia family. Old Madam Jia, fond of her composed and kind demeanor, decided to personally contribute twenty taels of silver and instructed Xifeng to prepare a feast and hire an opera troupe.

Xifeng, always playful, laughed and said, "When an elder like you hosts a birthday for the younger generation, who would dare complain? But why bother with a banquet? If you truly want a lively event, you’ll have to dig into the family funds yourself. Now you suddenly pull out these measly twenty taels and expect us to chip in? If you truly couldn’t afford it, that would be one thing. But your chests are so full of gold and silver they’re nearly collapsing, and yet you still have us running around. Look at us—aren’t we also your grandchildren? Or do you plan for only Baoyu to inherit everything and leave the rest of us with nothing?"

Her words made everyone burst into laughter.

Old Madam Jia also laughed, "Just listen to that tongue! I always thought I was sharp-witted, but I can't outmatch this little monkey. Even your mother wouldn’t dare argue with me like this, yet you dare to spar with me!"

Xifeng playfully responded, "That’s because my mother-in-law is also biased toward Baoyu. I have nowhere to voice my grievances, so you accuse me of arguing!"

Hearing this, Old Madam Jia chuckled even more, thoroughly enjoying Xifeng’s humor.

Baochai’s Birthday and the Opera Performance
On Baochai’s birthday, the inner courtyard was set up with a small stage. A newly formed opera troupe was invited to perform, including both Kunqu and Yiyang operatic styles.

The banquet was a private gathering. Apart from the Jia family, only Xue Baochai, her mother Madam Xue, and Shi Xiangyun were considered guests.

Early that morning, Baoyu noticed that Daiyu wasn’t present and went to her room to find her lying in bed.

Baoyu said with a smile, "Get up and eat. The opera is starting soon. Which play do you want to hear? I’ll choose one for you."

Daiyu coldly replied, "If you really meant it, you would have hired a private troupe just to perform for me. No need to pretend now."

Baoyu laughed, "That’s no problem! Tomorrow, I’ll hire an entire troupe just for you."

He then pulled her up, and they walked hand-in-hand to the dining area.

After breakfast, it was time to choose the performances. Old Madam Jia first asked Baochai to pick a play. Baochai modestly declined but, after repeated requests, finally selected a scene from Journey to the West, which delighted Old Madam Jia.

Next, Madam Xue was asked to choose, but she refused since Baochai had already made a selection.

Old Madam Jia then turned to Xifeng, who, knowing that Old Madam Jia enjoyed comedic plays, picked Liu Er Buys Clothes, a humorous and lively piece. As expected, Old Madam Jia loved it.

Lin Daiyu was then asked to choose, but she insisted that Wang Furen and the other elders should select first.

Old Madam Jia waved her hand, "Today is for our enjoyment! We’re not here for them. I’m hosting this opera and banquet for you all, not them! They’re already lucky to eat for free—why let them pick plays too?"

Hearing this, everyone laughed, and Daiyu finally selected a play.

Afterward, Baoyu, Xiangyun, Yingchun, Xichun, and Li Wan also picked their preferred scenes.

When it was time to serve the wine, Old Madam Jia again asked Baochai to choose a play. She selected The Mountain Gate, which Baoyu disapproved of.

"You always pick these types of plays," Baoyu muttered.

Baochai responded, "You’ve listened to opera for years, but do you even know why this play is excellent? It’s beautifully structured, with exquisite lyrics and powerful rhythm. One section of it contains a Jishengcao (a poetic verse), which is particularly marvelous. You wouldn’t understand it."

Baoyu, intrigued, pleaded, "Good sister, read it for me!"

Baochai recited:

Heroes weep in vain as they part ways,
A monk seeks refuge in the Lotus Terrace.
Fate is fleeting, like mist in the wind,
We come and go with nothing to hold.
No shelter for this wandering soul,
Just a worn-out robe and a broken bowl.
Baoyu was enthralled, nodding and exclaiming in admiration. He praised Baochai’s literary knowledge, but Daiyu interjected sarcastically, "Just sit still and watch the play! The Mountain Gate hasn’t even started, and you’re already acting like a lunatic!"

Xiangyun also laughed at Baoyu's reaction.

That night, after the opera ended, the family discussed the young actors. Old Madam Jia was particularly fond of the boy playing the female role (dan) and the boy playing the clown (chou). She had them brought in and was even more charmed upon seeing them up close. She inquired about their ages and learned that the dan was eleven years old and the chou was only nine.

Everyone sighed in sympathy, and Old Madam Jia ordered extra food and money to be given to the two children.

Xifeng laughed, "This little one looks just like someone we know. Can’t you all see the resemblance?"

Baochai understood but said nothing.

Baoyu nodded slightly but also remained silent.

Xiangyun blurted out, "I know! He looks just like Sister Lin (Daiyu)!"

Baoyu shot her a warning glance.

The others, hearing this, carefully examined the boy’s features and burst into laughter, saying, "Indeed, he does resemble her!"

With this, the lively birthday celebration continued into the night.
Xiangyun’s Misunderstanding and Baoyu’s Frustration
That night, after the opera, Shi Xiangyun instructed Cuilu to pack their belongings.

Cuilu asked, "Why the rush? We can pack tomorrow before leaving."

Xiangyun replied angrily, "I’m leaving early in the morning. I don’t want to stay here any longer—why should I keep watching people’s attitudes?"

Baoyu, hearing this, quickly stepped in and said, "Good sister, you’ve misunderstood me. Lin Daiyu is sensitive, and everyone knows it. Even if they notice something, they won’t say it aloud to avoid upsetting her. But you said it outright, which made her feel embarrassed. I was only trying to stop you from getting into trouble, yet now you’re angry at me instead. If I had a bad heart, may I turn to dust and let everyone trample on me!"

Xiangyun huffed, "Spare me your flowery words! I know I’m not as clever as your dear Lin Daiyu. Others can joke about her, but if I do, it’s suddenly wrong! I’m not even fit to talk to her, am I? She’s the noble young lady, and I’m just a lowly servant girl!"

Baoyu, growing anxious, said, "I was only trying to help you, and now I’m the one being scolded. If that’s how it is, then I’d rather be silent from now on!"

Xiangyun snapped, "Don’t say things like that during the New Year! If you want to talk, go speak with those who love getting angry and controlling you. Just leave me alone!"

With that, she stormed off into Old Madam Jia’s room and lay down, fuming.

Baoyu, feeling helpless, went to see Daiyu instead.

However, as soon as he entered her room, Daiyu pushed him out and shut the door.

Baoyu was confused and stood outside, softly calling, "Good sister, good sister."

Daiyu ignored him.

Baoyu, disheartened, stood silently in front of the window.

Inside, Daiyu had overheard his conversation with Xiangyun earlier. Though she was annoyed, she knew there was no point in arguing further at this moment.

When Daiyu eventually opened the door, she was startled to find Baoyu still standing there.

Feeling awkward, she stepped aside and let him in.

Baoyu asked, "Why are you mad at me?"

Daiyu sneered, "How would I know? I exist just to be your joke, don’t I? Now people compare me to opera actors for fun!"

Baoyu protested, "I never made that comparison, nor did I laugh at you. Why blame me?"

Daiyu retorted, "Even if you didn’t say it, your silence was worse than laughing! You should have defended me! But no, you just stood there, making eyes at Xiangyun. What was that about? Were you afraid she would disgrace herself by speaking to someone like me? She is the daughter of a noble family, and I am just a lowly orphan girl, right?!"

Baoyu finally understood that Daiyu had overheard his conversation with Xiangyun. He had tried to mediate between them, but now he was being criticized from both sides.

His thoughts turned to what he had read in the Zhuangzi:

"The clever labor, the wise worry, and the unskilled are carefree, eating simple meals and wandering without attachment, floating like an untethered boat."

"The trees on the mountain invite their own felling, and the flowing spring drains itself dry."

He sighed inwardly.

"If I can’t even manage these few relationships, how will I ever navigate the world?"

Feeling utterly drained, he turned and left without another word.

Daiyu, realizing that he was truly upset, grew angrier and called out after him, "Fine! Go! And don’t ever come back again!"

Baoyu did not look back and returned to his room, lying down in frustration.

Baoyu’s Existential Reflection (Continued)
After writing his verse, Baoyu recited it to himself, feeling his emotions ease. Then, he lay back down and fell into a restless sleep.

Meanwhile, Lin Daiyu, having noticed Baoyu’s abrupt departure, pretended to look for Xiren as an excuse to check on him.

Xiren, seeing her enter, smiled and handed her Baoyu’s writing.

"Take a look at what he wrote," Xiren said.

Daiyu read the verses carefully and immediately understood that they were born from Baoyu’s frustration and sorrow.

She sighed, both amused and touched, and said, "It’s just idle musings. Nothing serious."

Then, without another word, she took the paper and brought it back to her own room.

The next day, she showed it to Baochai and Xiangyun.

Baochai read the poem aloud:

"I am not you; you do not understand me.
I come and go, unhindered and free.
The world’s affairs, why should they concern me?
Joys and sorrows, why should they trouble me?
I busied myself in vain,
Only to realize how laughable it all is!"
Baochai, after reading it, moved on to the Zen-inspired verse. Then, she sighed and said, "This is my fault. If I hadn’t recited that opera verse yesterday, he wouldn’t have fallen into this strange mood. These Daoist teachings are tricky; once they take hold, they can change a person’s entire outlook. If he really starts to believe this nonsense, I’ll be to blame for it!"

With that, she ripped the poem into tiny pieces and ordered the maids to burn it.

Daiyu chuckled. "You should have kept it so I could confront him and break him out of this foolishness."

The three girls then went to see Baoyu.

Daiyu teased, "Baoyu, let me ask you something. The most precious thing is 'bao' (treasure), and the strongest thing is 'yu' (jade). Tell me, what makes you so precious? What makes you so strong?"

Baoyu was caught off guard and could not answer.

Baochai and Xiangyun burst into laughter. "You claim to be enlightened, yet you can’t even answer this simple question!"

Xiangyun clapped her hands. "Baoyu lost!"

Daiyu added, "You wrote: 'To have no attachments is true peace.' That’s good. But I would add: 'To have no place to stand is true freedom.'"

Baochai laughed, "That’s a real Zen awakening. It reminds me of when Master Huineng went to study at the temple in Huangmei. The elder monks were all asked to write a verse. The head monk, Shenxiu, wrote:

'The body is a Bodhi tree,
The mind is a bright mirror.
Constantly dust it clean,
Lest it gather dirt.'
"Huineng, a mere kitchen boy, overheard and said, 'It’s good, but it’s not quite right.' So he wrote his own:

'The Bodhi tree is not a tree,
The bright mirror is not a mirror.
From the start, there is nothing at all,
Where can dust settle?'
"And with that, he was chosen as the true successor of Zen.

"Baoyu, your verse carries a similar idea. But Daiyu just completed your thought. Would you abandon it now?"

Daiyu smirked. "He lost the argument. Even if he finds an answer now, it won’t count."

Baoyu, realizing that both Daiyu and Baochai were more knowledgeable than he had thought, felt humbled.

"So you’ve both been enlightened long before me!" he muttered, finally understanding his own folly.

"Who said I was trying to study Zen? It was just idle musing," he said with a sheepish grin.

With that, the four of them resumed their usual cheerful banter.

The Lantern Riddles from the Palace
Just then, a servant arrived and announced:

"Her Highness the Imperial Consort has sent a lantern riddle challenge for everyone to solve. Each of you must write a response and also submit your own riddle for Her Highness to guess."

The four of them, excited, rushed to Grandmother Jia’s quarters, where the eunuch messenger stood holding a four-sided white silk lantern with a riddle inscribed on it.

Everyone gathered to read it and began making guesses.

The eunuch then conveyed a message from the palace:

"Once you solve the riddle, do not say the answer aloud. Instead, write it down. All responses will be sealed and sent to Her Highness. She will determine if the answers are correct."

Baochai took one look and instantly knew the answer but kept a composed expression, saying, "This is tricky." She pretended to ponder, though she had already written down her answer.

Baoyu, Daiyu, Xiangyun, and Tan Chun also quickly wrote their guesses. Soon, the others, including Jia Huan and Jia Lan, were called to participate.

Afterward, each person created their own riddle, wrote it neatly on paper, and attached it to the lantern.

The eunuch took the sealed responses and riddles back to the palace.

That night, a second message arrived:

"Her Highness has reviewed all responses. Most of the young ladies answered correctly, except for Second Miss and Third Young Master. As for the riddles composed by everyone here, Her Highness has solved them all."

The eunuch then presented small prizes from the palace—each correct guesser received an elegantly crafted poem case and a delicate tea whisk. Only Yingchun and Jia Huan received nothing.

Yingchun did not mind at all, treating it as a small game. However, Jia Huan felt humiliated.

Worse, the eunuch then said, "Third Young Master, the Imperial Consort could not even determine what your riddle meant. She asked me to bring it back and have you explain it."

Everyone burst into laughter.

Jia Huan’s riddle read:

"The eldest has eight horns,
The second has only two.
The first sits on the bed,
The second perches on the roof."
Confused, the eunuch asked, "What is this supposed to be?"

Jia Huan mumbled, "A pillow and a beast-head ornament."

The eunuch noted it down and left.

Meanwhile, Grandmother Jia, seeing how much fun everyone was having, became even more delighted. She ordered a beautifully crafted lantern screen to be set up in the main hall so that each young lady could write her own riddle and attach it to the screen.

She also prepared tea, snacks, and gifts for those who solved the riddles.

That evening, even Jia Zheng came to join the fun. Normally, he was strict, but since it was the holiday season, he made an exception.

Jia Zheng’s Riddle Challenge
Jia Zheng noticed that Jia Lan was absent and asked, "Why isn’t Lan here?"

A maid ran to ask Lady Li, who laughed, "He said Father didn’t call for him, so he refused to come."

Hearing this, everyone chuckled.

"That boy is so stubborn!" someone commented.

Jia Zheng ordered Jia Huan to fetch him.

When Jia Lan arrived, Grandmother Jia had him sit beside her and handed him some sweets.

Although the gathering was lively, many were restrained in front of Jia Zheng. Even Shi Xiangyun, usually outspoken, fell silent. Daiyu was naturally quiet, and Baochai remained composed as always.

Sensing the tension, Grandmother Jia joked, "Let’s lighten up the mood! I’ll give Old Master Jia a riddle. If you can’t guess it, you’ll be punished!"

Jia Zheng smiled. "I accept the challenge. But if I guess correctly, I deserve a prize!"

Grandmother Jia recited:

"A nimble creature perches in the trees. (Guess a fruit.)"
Jia Zheng pretended to struggle and guessed incorrectly several times before finally saying, "It must be a lychee!"

Everyone laughed.

As the night deepened, Jia Zheng eventually excused himself, leaving the young people to play freely.

And so the joyous festival continued.
Chapter 23

Skilled Verses from Romance of the Western Chamber Evoke Playful Banter; Elegant Songs from The Peony Pavilion Stir Tender Hearts

The next day, the Lady Dowager continued leading the family in their festival celebrations. After the Imperial Consort’s excursion to the Grand View Garden and her return to the palace, she instructed that all the poems composed on that occasion be collected. Tan-chun was tasked with transcribing them, and the Consort herself ranked their quality. She then ordered the poems to be inscribed on stone tablets within the Grand View Garden, commemorating the affair as a timeless act of refined elegance. Consequently, Jia Zheng arranged for skilled craftsmen to be selected to carve the stone, while Jia Zhen, along with Jia Rong and Jia Qiang, supervised the work. Since Jia Qiang was also in charge of costumes and other matters for the troupe of twelve female performers, he was too occupied to oversee the stone carving full-time. Jia Zhen therefore summoned Jia Chang, Jia Ling, and Jia Ping to assist. On a certain day, the work of waxing and chiseling began in earnest, but we’ll leave that aside for now.

Meanwhile, the temple of the Jade Emperor and the Dharma Nunnery, both previously housed within the Grand View Garden, had been vacated. The twelve young Buddhist novices and twelve Taoist acolytes who resided there needed new accommodations. Jia Zheng was considering where to relocate them when Lady Yang, the mother of Jia Qin and a resident of a nearby street, heard about this. Wishing to secure a small administrative position for her son and thereby gain some financial benefit, she took a carriage to appeal to Wang Xifeng. Xifeng, known for her sharp tongue and quick wit, readily agreed to help. She proposed a plan to Lady Wang, explaining, "We shouldn’t dismiss these young monks and Taoists to various places, as the Imperial Consort might call for their services again. Dispersing them would make it difficult to assemble them later. I suggest sending them all to our family’s ancestral temple, the Iron Threshold Monastery. It would only take a small monthly stipend to cover their food and firewood. When needed, we can simply summon them back without any trouble."

Lady Wang discussed the idea with Jia Zheng, who, seeing its practicality, immediately approved. He called for Jia Lian. At that moment, Jia Lian was dining with Xifeng. Hearing himself summoned, he set down his bowl and prepared to leave. Xifeng caught his arm, saying, "Wait a moment and listen to me first. If it’s about those young monks and Taoists, do as I say." She outlined her plan in detail. Jia Lian laughed, "I’m not getting involved. If you’re so capable, why don’t you tell them yourself?" Xifeng set down her chopsticks, glanced at him with a half-smile, and asked, "Are you joking, or are you serious?" Jia Lian replied, "I promised Wu Sao’s son, Yun, that he could manage a task like this. After all his pleading, I finally agreed. But now you’re trying to take it away." Xifeng smiled and said, "Don’t worry. The northeast corner of the garden still needs to be planted with more pine and cypress trees, as per the Consort’s instructions. Once that project comes up, I’ll make sure Yun takes charge of it." Jia Lian nodded. As he got up, he teasingly whispered, "By the way, why were you so stiff and uncooperative last night when I wanted to try something different?" Xifeng’s face flushed as she laughed and gave a soft humph. Lowering her head, she resumed eating, while Jia Lian left smiling.

When Jia Lian arrived in front of Jia Zheng, he followed Xifeng’s instructions and proposed that Jia Qin oversee the monks and Taoists. "It seems Jia Qin has potential," he said. "This responsibility can be assigned to him. Following our household rules, he’ll receive a monthly stipend accordingly." Jia Zheng, not concerned with minor details, agreed. Jia Lian returned to tell Xifeng, who promptly sent a message to Lady Yang. Jia Qin came to express his heartfelt gratitude to Jia Lian and Xifeng. Xifeng even arranged an advance payment of three months’ expenses, asking Jia Qin to sign a receipt and having Jia Lian countersign it. The treasury then issued 300 silver taels. Jia Qin gave a portion to the overseers, saying, "Treat yourselves to some tea," before taking the rest home to discuss matters with his mother. They immediately hired carriages and transported the twenty-four novices and acolytes to the Iron Threshold Monastery.

Back at the palace, the Imperial Consort was reviewing the Grand View Garden Anthology she had compiled. Reflecting on the garden’s beauty, she realized that since her visit, Jia Zheng had likely kept it strictly closed, leaving its splendor unseen and its potential wasted. Moreover, the household still had several talented young women who excelled at poetry and the arts. Why not let them move into the garden? That way, the garden would remain vibrant, and the women would have a more fitting environment. Since Baoyu had grown up among these women and was unlike his other brothers, not sending him into the garden might feel like an oversight, potentially upsetting both the Lady Dowager and Lady Wang. She thus issued a decree through the eunuch Xia Zhong, ordering Baoyu and the young ladies to move into the garden. Baoyu was also to continue his studies there.

Jia Zheng and Lady Wang received the decree and reported it to the Lady Dowager, who immediately arranged for servants to clean and prepare the garden’s residences, complete with curtains, bedding, and furnishings. While others reacted calmly, Baoyu was overjoyed. As he and the Lady Dowager discussed what he might need, a maid came to say, "Master Jia Zheng has summoned Baoyu." Baoyu froze, his enthusiasm vanishing. His complexion turned pale, and he clung to the Lady Dowager, utterly reluctant to go. The Lady Dowager reassured him, saying, "Don’t worry, my dear. I’m here for you. He won’t mistreat you. He probably just wants to remind you to behave properly. Whatever he says, just agree with him." She then called two older maids and instructed them to escort Baoyu and make sure Jia Zheng didn’t frighten him. With no choice, Baoyu shuffled off reluctantly, barely moving three inches with each step.

By chance, Jia Zheng was in Lady Wang’s quarters discussing family matters. The maids Jin Chuan’er, Cai Yun, Xiu Luan, and Xiu Feng were waiting under the eaves. When they saw Baoyu approach, they all smirked. Jin Chuan’er grabbed Baoyu’s arm and whispered teasingly, "I just put on some sweet-scented rouge. Want a taste?" Cai Yun pushed her away, laughing, "He’s already nervous. Stop teasing him! Hurry on inside while he’s still willing." Baoyu sighed and stepped into the room.

Inside, Jia Zheng and Lady Wang were seated on the kang. The chairs below were occupied by Ying-chun, Tan-chun, Xi-chun, and Jia Huan. When Baoyu entered, Tan-chun, Xi-chun, and Jia Huan stood up. Jia Zheng glanced at Baoyu, noting his graceful demeanor and attractive features, which stood in stark contrast to Jia Huan’s unimpressive appearance and clumsy manners. The sight brought back memories of his late son Jia Zhu. He also looked at Lady Wang, who had only this one beloved son. Seeing his own beard turning gray, Jia Zheng’s usual disdain for Baoyu softened significantly. After a moment, he said, "The Consort has instructed that you’ve been spending too much time playing and have grown neglectful of your studies. She wants you to join your sisters in the garden to focus on your lessons. You’d better study diligently. If you continue being careless, you’ll be in serious trouble." Baoyu quickly replied, "Yes, sir!" several times. Lady Wang then pulled him closer, asking, "Have you finished the pills I gave you the other day?" Baoyu answered, "There’s one left." Lady Wang said, "Get another ten tomorrow. Take one every night before bed, and have Xi Ren help you." Baoyu replied, "As you instructed, Xi Ren has been giving them to me every night." Jia Zheng asked, "Who’s Xi Ren?" Lady Wang said, "She’s one of the maids." Jia Zheng frowned, "Why give a maid such an odd name? Who came up with that?" Sensing Jia Zheng’s displeasure, Lady Wang quickly explained, "The Lady Dowager named her." Jia Zheng remarked, "The Lady Dowager wouldn’t come up with something like that. It must have been Baoyu." Baoyu, unable to deny it, confessed, "I remembered a line from a poem: ‘The floral fragrance wafts, heralding the warmth of day.’ Since this maid’s surname is Hua, I named her Xi Ren on a whim." Lady Wang quickly said, "Well, change her name then. Don’t upset your father over something so small." Jia Zheng waved it off, "There’s no need to change it. It’s just another sign of Baoyu’s frivolity—always busy with flowery poems instead of serious work." With that, he barked, "You worthless brat, leave now!" Lady Wang added, "Off you go. The Lady Dowager is probably waiting for lunch."

Baoyu bowed and left. Outside, Jin Chuan’er playfully stuck out her tongue at him. Accompanied by the two older maids, he hurried back to the Lady Dowager’s quarters. There, he found Lin Daiyu. He asked her, "Which residence would you like to stay in?" Daiyu had been pondering the same question. Hearing Baoyu’s inquiry, she replied, "I’m thinking of choosing Xiaoxiang Pavilion. I like those bamboo groves and the winding veranda—so peaceful and secluded." Baoyu clapped his hands in delight, saying, "That’s exactly what I wanted! You’ll stay there, and I’ll be in Yihong Court. We’ll be close and both enjoy the tranquility." As they discussed the matter, a servant arrived from Jia Zheng, suggesting the siblings move into the garden on February 22nd. In the following days, servants were sent to allocate and tidy the spaces. Baochai was assigned Hengwu Lodge, Daiyu took Xiaoxiang Pavilion, Ying-chun moved into Zhijin Tower, Tan-chun settled in Autumn Study, Xi-chun took up residence in Liu-feng Studio, Li Wan chose Daoxiang Village, and Baoyu stayed in Yihong Court. Each location was staffed with two senior maids and four junior ones, in addition to the ladies’ personal attendants. By the twenty-second, everyone had moved in, transforming the garden into a lively and vibrant scene once more.
Chapter 24
Drunken Jin Gang, Who Values Honor Over Wealth;
The Lovelorn Maiden’s Lost Handkerchief Awakens Longing

As Lin Daiyu sat lost in her swirling, tender thoughts, someone suddenly tapped her from behind and said, “What are you doing here all by yourself?” Startled, Daiyu whipped around to see none other than Xiangling.
“Ah, you foolish maid,” Daiyu chided, “scaring me so recklessly! Where on earth have you come from at this hour?”
Giggling, Xiangling replied, “I came to look for our mistress, but I couldn’t find her anywhere. Also, Zijuan was calling for you—she said that Lady Lian sent over some tea leaves. Let’s go back home and sit awhile.”

Saying this, Xiangling grasped Daiyu’s hand and led her back to Xiaoxiang Pavilion. Sure enough, there were two small jars of fresh tea leaves delivered by Lady Lian. Daiyu and Xiangling sat down together, chatting about whose embroidery was finer and whose stitches were more exquisite; they played a quick game of chess and read a few lines of poetry before Xiangling departed without further ado.

Meanwhile, Baoyu, having been summoned back to his room by Xi Ren, found Yuanyang lounging on the bed while inspecting Xi Ren’s needlework. Noticing Baoyu’s arrival, she said, “Where have you been off to? The Old Lady is waiting for you. She wants you to go and pay your respects to the Master. Hurry up and change your clothes and get going!”
Xi Ren then went into the room to fetch his garments. Sitting at the edge of the bed, Baoyu slipped off his shoes and waited as his boots were put on. Glancing back, he saw Yuanyang dressed in a water-red silk jacket with a blue satin vest; her jade-colored silk stockings peeked out beneath her bright red embroidered shoes, and a purple silk scarf was neatly tied around her neck as she bent over, focused on her needlework.
Unable to resist, Baoyu pressed his face close to her neck, inhaling the delicate fragrance and continually caressing her smooth, fair skin—whose softness, he thought, rivaled even Xi Ren’s. Overcome with mischief, he grinned and teased, “Dear sister, why don’t you let me taste that rouge on your lips?” As he spoke, he clung to her as if he were sticky candy.
Yuanyang then called out, “Xi Ren, come and see! You’ve never even bothered to dissuade him—he’s still like this after all these years!”
Xi Ren emerged with Baoyu’s clothes and reproached him, “No matter how much I warn you, you never change! If you continue like this, you’ll surely make a mess of things.” While chiding him, she hurried him to dress and led him, along with Yuanyang, out the door.

After paying their respects to the Lady Dowager, they went outside where horses and servants were all in readiness. Just as Baoyu was about to mount his horse, he saw Jia Lian returning and dismounting. The two exchanged greetings, and then a young man stepped forward and said, “Greetings, Uncle Bao.”
Baoyu looked him over—a young man with a long, oval face and a tall, slender frame, no more than eighteen or nineteen years old, possessing a refined and scholarly air. Though his face was familiar, Baoyu couldn’t immediately recall from which branch of the family he came or his name.
Jia Lian laughed and said, “What’s the matter? Don’t you recognize him? He’s Yun, the son of Wu Sao, who lives under the gallery.”
Baoyu laughed, “Ah, of course—I nearly forgot!” Then he asked, “How is your mother? And what brings you here at this time?”
Jia Yun motioned toward Jia Lian and said, “I have come to speak with my second uncle.”
Baoyu teased, “You’re starting to look more and more like my own son!”
Jia Lian chuckled, “Oh, don’t be shameless—he’s five or six years older than you, and you already wish to make him your son?”
Baoyu grinned and inquired, “How old are you now?”
“Eighteen,” Jia Yun replied. Being the clever and sprightly fellow he was, upon hearing Baoyu compare him to his son, he laughed and said, “There’s an old saying: ‘A grandfather in a rocking chair, a grandson with a crutch.’ Even if I’m older, the sun cannot be hidden by mountains. Since my father passed away and no one has cared for me these past years, if Uncle Bao doesn’t mind taking me as his own, it would truly be my good fortune.”
Jia Lian laughed, “You heard him—taking you as his son would cause endless fuss!”
Smiling broadly, Baoyu said, “When you’re free tomorrow, just come and see me. Don’t sneak around like that with the others. I’m rather busy now, but tomorrow come to my study, and we’ll talk all day—I’ll even take you out to play in the garden.”
With that, he mounted his horse, and a group of servants followed him as he headed toward Jia She’s side.

When Baoyu met Jia She, the latter was suffering only from a slight chill. After recounting the Lady Dowager’s inquiries and exchanging greetings, Jia She stood to respond to her questions and then ordered, “Bring our boy into the mistress’s quarters to sit with her.”
Baoyu then stepped away and proceeded to the inner chambers. There, in the upper room, Lady Xing greeted him warmly; she rose to welcome him with the Lady Dowager’s greetings before Baoyu himself returned the salutations. Lady Xing led him onto the kang to sit and then inquired after others, ordering tea to be served.
Before the tea was finished, Jia Cong came in to greet Baoyu. Lady Xing scolded him, “Where on earth have you been, you little scamp! Ever since your wet nurse died, you haven’t been properly cared for—look at your dark eyebrows and sallow face! How can you possibly be a proper child of a noble family?”
Just then, Jia Huan and Jia Lan, a pair of young cousins, also arrived to pay their respects. Lady Xing seated them in chairs.
Noticing that Baoyu was seated so closely with Lady Xing, who fussed over him in every possible way, Jia Huan began to feel uneasy. After a short while, he exchanged a knowing glance with Jia Lan and signaled his wish to leave. Jia Lan had no choice but to follow suit, and they both rose to bid farewell.
Seeing them get up, Baoyu too was about to leave, but Lady Xing smiled and said, “You stay a bit longer—I still have something to discuss with you.”
Reluctantly, Baoyu remained seated as Lady Xing told them, “You both head off now and convey my regards to your mothers. Your aunts and older sisters are all here, and all this bustle is making my head spin. I won’t have you stay for dinner today.”
The cousins obediently agreed and left.
Baoyu then said with a smile, “But all my elder sisters are here—where have they gone?”
Lady Xing replied, “They sat for a while and then went off to some other room.”
Baoyu inquired, “The Mistress said ‘I have something to say’—what did she mean?”
Lady Xing laughed, “There’s nothing to it; she simply wants you to wait until you’ve had dinner with your sisters. Then there’s a little something fun for you to take home and play with.”

Soon enough, dinner was served. The young ladies were invited in, and tables and chairs were arranged as cups and plates were laid out. After the mothers and daughters finished their meal, Baoyu took his leave of Jia She, then accompanied his sisters back home. After paying respects to the Lady Dowager, Lady Wang, and the rest, everyone retired to their rooms for the night.

Meanwhile, Jia Yun went in to see Jia Lian and inquired, “Is there any work available?”
Jia Lian explained, “A while back there was a project, but your aunt practically pleaded with me and handed it over to Qin. She said, ‘Tomorrow, there are still several spots in the garden where new trees and flowers must be planted. When that project comes up, it’ll be all yours.’”
After a long pause, Jia Yun said, “If that’s so, I’ll just wait. Uncle need not mention my inquiry to Aunt for now; we can discuss it later when you’re free.”
Jia Lian replied, “Why mention it at all? I haven’t got time for idle chatter. Tomorrow I must go on an inspection in Xingyi and must return that very day. Just wait for now, and after a few more days, come ask for a written order—if you come too early, I won’t be free.” With that, he went off to change his clothes.

After leaving Rongguo Mansion, Jia Yun, deep in thought, devised a plan and made his way directly to his uncle Bu Shiren’s place. Bu Shiren had recently opened a spice shop and had just returned from there when he saw Jia Yun and asked, “What brings you here?”
Jia Yun replied, “I have a favor to ask, Uncle—I need some borneol and musk. Surely you can extend me four taels on credit for each, and I’ll pay you with the proper silver during the Mid-Autumn Festival.”
Bu Shiren scoffed, “Don’t even mention extending credit! Just the other day, one of our clerks extended credit for a relative’s purchase and hasn’t been repaid yet. We all ended up on the hook, and now we’ve drawn up contracts forbidding any credit for relatives. Whoever dares violate this will be fined twenty taels! Besides, our supplies are low; if you come with cash to buy from our little shop, we won’t have much to spare. You’d just be shortchanged. And what business do you have that is so proper? Extending credit for frivolous matters is nothing but trouble. You act as if, upon seeing you, Uncle will immediately send you off on errands—your family is so ungrateful, always scheming to make a little extra money for food and clothing. I must say, I rather like that about you.”
Jia Yun laughed and said, “Uncle, you speak truly. When my father was alive I was but a child and knew nothing. Later, I heard Mother say that we were fortunate because you helped sort out the funeral affairs. Could it be that you didn’t know—or perhaps there’s a plot that I’ve squandered an acre of land and two rooms of property? As the saying goes, ‘A clever wife cannot make a meal without rice.’ What am I to do? I’m lucky indeed; otherwise, if any other shameless fellow came around every few days asking for three sheng of rice and two sheng of beans, there’d be no way for you to manage!”
Bu Shiren said, “My son, if Uncle has to extend credit, then it must be done properly. I always tell your aunt, ‘My only worry is that you haven’t got your act together.’ If you can pull yourself together in your main household, even if your relatives never see you, you can still blow off some steam with the men in charge and get something done. The other day when I left the city, I ran into the fourth master from your three households—he was riding in a fine carriage, accompanied by four or five vehicles and with some forty or fifty little monks and Taoist acolytes in tow, all heading to the ancestral temple. If he isn’t competent, then he’ll surely have such a project fall to him.”
Jia Yun, wearied by his uncle’s rambling, got up to take his leave.
Bu Shiren said, “Why are you in such a hurry? Go have your meal.”
Before he could finish speaking, his wife interjected, “You’re so confused again! They say there’s no rice, yet they’ve bought you half a jin of flour to make a meal—and now you act as if you’re too full! Do you really want your nephew to starve?”
Bu Shiren replied, “Then just buy another half a jin to add on.”
His wife then called their daughter, “Yin Jie, go ask Mrs. Wang across the way if you can borrow a few dozen taels; they’ll deliver it tomorrow.”
While the couple talked, Jia Yun quickly said a few words like “No need to trouble yourself” and disappeared without a trace.

Not mentioning the details of Bu Shiren’s household any further, we turn back to Jia Yun, who, in a fit of pique, left his uncle’s home and trudged back alone, his mind troubled with thoughts. As he walked with his head bowed, he suddenly collided with a drunken man who grabbed him and shouted, “Have you lost your eyes? You bumped into me!”
Hearing the familiar tone, Jia Yun looked up and recognized the man as Ni Er, who lived next door—a rogue notorious for charging exorbitant interest, known for his gambling, drinking, and frequent brawls. At that moment, Ni Er had just been collecting debts from someone and was well into his drunken stupor. Noticing Jia Yun’s collision, he was about to start a fight.
Jia Yun cried out, “Ni Er, hold on! It’s only I who bumped into you.”
Ni Er, upon hearing his tone, opened his bleary eyes and, seeing it was Jia Yun, quickly released him and wobbled with a laugh, “So it’s Jia Er Ye! And where are you off to now?”
Jia Yun retorted, “Don’t mention it—you’ve just made a fool of me for nothing!”
Ni Er said, “Never mind. If something’s amiss, tell me and I’ll set you straight. In these three streets and six alleys, if anyone offends me—Ni Er, the Drunken Jin Gang—I’ll make sure they’re scattered far and wide!”
Jia Yun said, “Ni Er, please, don’t be angry. Let me explain the matter.” And he proceeded to recount the episode involving Bu Shiren.
Listening intently, Ni Er became furious and declared, “If it weren’t for my family connection, I’d let loose a string of curses! Truly, this infuriates me. But never mind—you need not worry; I have a few taels of silver on hand. Take it if you need it. We good neighbors here don’t charge interest on such favors.” As he spoke, he rummaged in his bag and pulled out a packet of silver.
Jia Yun thought to himself, “Although Ni Er is a rogue, he does show generosity when it matters—he does have the air of a chivalrous hero. If I don’t accept his kindness now, he might feel ashamed, and that wouldn’t be proper. I might as well take it and repay him double later.” Laughing, Jia Yun said, “Ni Er, you truly are a good man. Since you’ve been so magnanimous, how can I refuse? I’ll even write up an IOU and send it home as usual.”
Ni Er laughed heartily, “It’s only about fifteen taels or so—if you need me to write up a contract, I won’t lend you any more!”
Jia Yun accepted the silver and replied, “I shall abide by your terms. There’s no need to rush!”
Ni Er grinned, “That’s the spirit. Now that it’s getting dark, I won’t let you drink any more. I have a few matters to attend to. Please take your leave. And I’d appreciate it if you could send a message to my family, telling them to lock the door and go to sleep. I won’t be coming home. If anything urgent happens, have one of the girls come find me early tomorrow at that horse-dealer’s place—Wang Duan Tui’s house.” With that, he staggered off.

Later, Jia Yun reflected on the incident and found Ni Er’s behavior rather admirable, though he worried that the rogue’s drunken generosity might compel him to ask for double repayment the next day. Then he thought, “No matter—I can repay him twice over if need be.”
He proceeded to a money shop, weighed the silver, and divided it equally, feeling ever more pleased. When he reached home, he immediately relayed Ni Er’s words to his mother.
His mother, who was sitting on the kang busy with needlework, asked, “Where have you been all day?”
Fearing his mother’s anger, Jia Yun avoided mentioning Bu Shiren’s matter and said, “I was waiting in the Western Mansion for Uncle Lian to come by.”
Then she asked, “Have you eaten?”
He replied, “Yes, there’s still some food left over.”
She ordered a little maid to bring it to him.

That evening, after the lights were lit, Jia Yun ate his meal, tidied up, and went to rest without another word.
The next day, after washing his face, he left through the South Gate and strolled along the main street. He stopped by a spice shop to buy some iced musk and then made his way to Rong Mansion. There he inquired about Jia Lian’s whereabouts.
Following Jia Lian’s trail, Jia Yun trailed behind until he reached the courtyard of Jia Lian’s residence, where a few young servants were busy sweeping with large, tall brooms. Suddenly, someone from the Zhou Rui household came out of the door and called to the servants, “Hold off on sweeping—the Old Lady has come out!”
Jia Yun quickly stepped forward and cheerfully asked, “Where is Second Aunt?”
A servant from Zhou Rui’s household replied, “The Old Lady called out; she’s probably here to have her dress measured.”
Just then, a crowd of people, led by Feng Jie, emerged.
Knowing well that Feng Jie loved to be flattered and to show off her grandeur, Jia Yun quickly put his hands together in deference and respectfully rushed forward to pay his respects. Feng Jie barely spared him a glance as she moved ahead, only asking about his mother, “Why aren’t you out here strolling with us?”
Jia Yun replied, “I’m not feeling well; I’ve been thinking about Second Aunt and wanted to catch a glimpse, though I couldn’t come over in person.”
Feng Jie laughed, “But you’re lying! Had I not mentioned it, you wouldn’t have thought of me at all.”
Jia Yun grinned and said, “A nephew who isn’t afraid of a bit of thunder can dare to lie in front of his elders? Last night you mentioned, ‘My dear, weak Second Aunt, though burdened with many affairs, somehow manages everything so thoroughly. Had it been any less, she would have been utterly exhausted!’”
Hearing this, Feng Jie’s face broke into a broad smile. She paused and asked, “How is it that you and your mother whisper such things about me behind my back?”
Jia Yun laughed and replied, “It’s only because I have a good friend who runs a spice shop. He recently donated a position to a magistrate and was selected for a post in Yunnan—taking his entire family along. Since his shop isn’t doing well these days, he’s gathered up his stock, giving away what’s valuable to his relatives and selling the rest cheaply. As a result, I managed to get hold of some borneol and musk. I discussed with my mother the idea of not selling these precious spices at a loss, since Second Aunt used to pay a fortune for them. Not only would they be used in the noble Consort’s palace this year, but even during the Duan Yang Festival they’d be worth several times more than usual. So I brought these as a token of filial piety to you.”
Handing over a jeweled box, Feng Jie—who was in the midst of preparing festive gifts with spices—smiled and ordered, “Take Yun Ge’s gift and send it home with Ping Er.” Then she added, “Seeing how sensible you are, no wonder your uncle speaks so highly of you—saying that you’re articulate and insightful.”
Jia Yun, pleased by her praise, stepped forward deliberately and asked, “So my uncle speaks of me as well?”
Feng Jie, about to explain further but fearing that might make him think less of her, merely said that with this small gift of spices, she was content to let him handle matters. Without mentioning the project to plant trees and flowers, she exchanged a few bland words and then went into the Lady Dowager’s quarters.

Jia Yun, naturally feeling somewhat put off, had no choice but to return. Since he had seen Baoyu yesterday, he waited in the outer study and ate his meal before proceeding to the Lady Dowager’s Qisan Study outside the main gate. There he saw Ming Yan busily handling some sparrows.
Standing behind Ming Yan, Jia Yun stamped his foot and said, “That little monkey Ming Yan is being naughty again!”
Ming Yan turned around, saw it was Jia Yun, and laughed, “Why must you startle us so, Second Master?” Then, still laughing, she added, “I won’t even be called Ming Yan anymore—our Baoyu dislikes the character ‘Yan’ and now calls me ‘Bei Ming.’ Just call me Bei Ming tomorrow, Second Master.”
Jia Yun nodded with a smile as he followed her into the study and sat down. “Has Baoyu come down yet?” he asked.
Bei Ming replied, “He hasn’t come down at all today. Second Master said nothing, so I’ll go check for you.” And with that, she went out.

Inside the study, Jia Yun looked over some calligraphy, paintings, and antiques. An entire meal passed with no word from Baoyu, and when he looked about for other young men to pass the time with, he found them all occupied elsewhere. Feeling rather bored, he suddenly heard a tender, youthful voice outside call, “Brother!”
Peeking out, Jia Yun saw a neatly turned-out maid of about fifteen or sixteen, with bright, sparkling eyes. Upon seeing him, she tried to slip away—just then, Bei Ming appeared and, noticing the maid at the door, exclaimed, “Ah, finally, a message at last!”
Jia Yun, noticing Bei Ming, hurried out and asked, “What’s the news?”
Bei Ming said, “I’ve been waiting for a while and no one has come. This is from inside Baoyu’s room.”
Then Jia Yun said, “Good girl, pass along a message: tell them that Second Master Yun has arrived.”
Hearing this, the maid—now aware that it was a member of the family—no longer tried to avoid him but fixed her eyes on him. Listening as Jia Yun said, “Forget about ‘upstairs’ or ‘downstairs’—just say it’s Yun,” after a moment she half-smiled and said, “In my opinion, Second Master, please go back for now and come again tomorrow. You’re not even awake yet tonight; surely you won’t be left starving here? It’s better to go home and come back when things are proper. Even if someone brings a message later, it’ll just be words.”
Finding her plain and lively words appealing, Jia Yun was about to ask her name, but since she was from Baoyu’s household and it wouldn’t be proper to inquire, he said, “Very well—I’ll come back tomorrow.” With that, he left.
Bei Ming called after him, “I’ll go serve some tea—wait for Second Master to finish drinking before you head off.”
Jia Yun replied as he walked away, “No need; I have other matters to attend to,” though he couldn’t help glancing back at the maid still standing there.

Later, Jia Yun returned. The next day, as he reached the main gate, he happened upon Feng Jie herself, who was out greeting guests. Just as she mounted her carriage, she saw Jia Yun approaching and ordered her servants to stop him. Peering out the window, she laughed and said, “Yun, you have the nerve to play tricks in front of me! No wonder you brought me something—it turns out you have something to ask of me. Just yesterday, your uncle told me you made a request of him.”
Jia Yun smiled and replied, “Regarding Uncle’s matter—please don’t mention it, Second Aunt—I’m now filled with regret. Had I known this would happen, I should have asked Second Aunt right away. It would have been settled long ago; who would have thought Uncle would refuse?”
Feng Jie laughed, “Oh! So nothing came of it on your side, and you came to see me again last night?”
Jia Yun said, “Second Aunt has disappointed my filial heart. I never intended it that way; if I had, I wouldn’t have hesitated to ask Second Aunt last night. Now that Second Aunt knows, I must put Uncle aside and have no choice but to ask you—you must at least spare me some affection.”
Feng Jie sneered, “Are you planning to take the long way around? If you had told me earlier, this small matter wouldn’t have been delayed until now. The garden still needs trees and flowers planted—I was just about to assign someone. Had you spoken sooner, it would all be finished by now.”
Jia Yun said, “So does that mean tomorrow you’ll have Second Aunt assign me?”
After a pause, Feng Jie said, “I don’t think that’s a good idea. Better wait until the grand festival of lanterns in January next year; then I might assign you.”
Jia Yun replied, “Very well, Second Aunt. Just assign me this project for now—if you handle this one well, then assign me the other matter later.”
Feng Jie laughed, “You sure know how to string things along! Fine then—if it weren’t for your uncle’s orders, I wouldn’t be meddling in your affairs. I simply came over after dinner, and you’re to come collect the silver at noon tomorrow. The day after tomorrow, you’ll go in to plant the trees and flowers.” With that, she ordered her carriage and drove off.

Overjoyed, Jia Yun made his way to the Qisan Study to inquire about Baoyu—but to his dismay, he found that Baoyu had already gone off early that morning to the residence of Prince Beijing. Jia Yun sat dumbfounded until noon. Later, when he learned that Feng Jie had returned, he went to write a receipt to collect the corresponding voucher. Outside the courtyard, he sent for Cai Ming, who came out, obtained the receipt, and after approving the silver amount, date, and voucher together, handed them over to Jia Yun.
Jia Yun looked over the document and saw that it amounted to two hundred taels of silver. Overcome with joy, he hurried to the treasury to collect the money and then rushed home to tell his mother, so that both mother and son were delighted.
The next day at dawn, Jia Yun first returned the silver to Ni Er, then took fifty taels of silver out the West Gate to purchase trees from the horticulturist Fang Chun’s household—needless to say, the matter proceeded smoothly.

As for Baoyu, ever since he met Jia Yun that day, he had mentioned that Jia Yun would come in tomorrow to speak with him—a petty squabble among the rich young men that he soon forgot. That very evening, Baoyu returned from the Prince Beijing mansion, met with the Lady Dowager, Lady Wang, and the others, and then came back to the garden. After changing his clothes and preparing for a bath, Xi Ren was sent off by Baochai to work on her hair, while Qiu Wen and Bi Hen hurried to fetch water. Tan Yun had been sent out because his mother was ill, and with Mao Yue also sick at home and several maids busy with heavy work, it seemed that everyone had gone off in search of companions.
Before long, Baoyu found himself alone in his room. Yet, he was suddenly struck with a desire for tea. After calling out two or three times, he saw two or three elderly maids enter. Seeing them, Baoyu quickly waved his hand, “No, no, that won’t be necessary.” The maids withdrew.
Finding no young maid available, Baoyu got up by himself, took a bowl, and went to pour tea from the teapot.
Then, from behind him, a voice said, “Second Master, your hand must be burning; allow me to pour it for you.” As the voice spoke, a maid came forward and took the bowl.
Startled, Baoyu asked, “Where did you come from? You appeared all of a sudden and frightened me!”
While handing him the tea, the maid smiled and replied, “I was in the back courtyard, just coming in through the back door. Didn’t you hear my footsteps?”
As Baoyu sipped his tea, he carefully observed the maid. She was dressed in several garments that were neither brand new nor old, with jet-black hair neatly tied up, a delicate, oval face, and a slender figure—truly charming and sweet.
Baoyu asked with a smile, “Are you one of the household maids?”
She replied with a cheerful laugh, “Yes.”
Baoyu said, “Since you belong to this household, how is it that I don’t recognize you?”
The maid snorted lightly and said, “There are many people you don’t recognize, not just me. I never serve tea or handle things in front of you, so how could you possibly know me?”
Baoyu asked, “Then why don’t you attend to what’s in front of you?”
The maid replied, “That’s hard to say. But I will tell you one thing, Second Master: Yesterday some Yun came looking for you. Thinking you wouldn’t have time, I sent Bei Ming to fetch him. Today he returned, yet it seems you’ve gone off again to the Northern Mansion.”
Just then, as she was speaking, Qiu Wen and Bi Hen came in laughing and joking, each carrying a bucket of water. They clumsily lifted their clothes, stumbling and splashing water everywhere. The maid quickly went out to meet them.
Qiu Wen complained, “You’ve soaked my clothes!” while Bi Hen added, “And you kicked my shoes!”
Suddenly, a person came out to fetch water. The two looked and recognized him—it was Xiao Hong. Both were startled; they set down the water and hurried over to see, only to find no one there but Baoyu. Feeling uneasy, they prepared the bathing items. When Baoyu had undressed, the two led him out the door and went to another room, where they found Xiao Hong and asked, “What were you doing in the room just now?”
Xiao Hong replied, “I was never in the room. My silk handkerchief was missing, so I went to search for it. Unexpectedly, Second Master needed tea. I called the elder sisters, but no one was available. I hurried in to pour a bowl of tea, and then the sisters arrived.”
Qiu Wen spat in disgust, “You shameless lowlife! I had expressly told you to hurry and fetch water, and you claim you had something to do—how dare you hog all the credit! With each step you take, aren’t you already late? Or do we simply not keep up with you? Look at yourself in the mirror—serving tea and water, you’re not fit for the task at all!”
Bi Hen said, “Tomorrow, I say we all just stand aside when it comes to tea or water. Just let him go—it’ll be fine.”
Qiu Wen retorted, “In that case, why don’t we just scatter and leave him alone in the room?”
As the two bantered back and forth, an old nanny entered bearing a message from Feng Jie: “Tomorrow, someone will bring in a team of horticulturists to plant trees. You must be strict—don’t let your clothes and skirts get all mixed up while drying. The earthen mound is surrounded by a curtain; don’t let anyone run off.”
Qiu Wen asked, “Who is it that’s bringing in the craftsmen to supervise tomorrow?”
The old nanny replied, “It’s that Yun Ge from the back corridor.”
Qiu Wen and Bi Hen were at a loss, and only continued to fuss about other matters. Xiao Hong, who understood in his heart that this was the same man seen yesterday in the outer study, knew full well.
It turned out that Xiao Hong’s family name was originally Lin, and his little name was Hongyu. But because the character “Yu” conflicted with the names of Baoyu and Daiyu, he was renamed “Xiao Hong.” He was a long-serving household servant whose father now managed the estate’s various fields and properties. At only fourteen, Xiao Hong had been assigned to work in Yihong Court—a quiet and refined post. Later, when the sisters and Baoyu were ordered to move into the Grand View Garden, this very residence was chosen, and Baoyu himself selected him. Although Xiao Hong was an inexperienced maid, blessed with a certain attractiveness, he secretly aspired to rise above his station and often tried to make himself noticed by Baoyu. However, with so many sharp-tongued, resourceful people around Baoyu, there was little room for him to insert himself. Today, after hearing some tidings and having endured harsh words from Qiu Wen and the others, his spirit had already been dampened considerably. Just then, he overheard the old nanny mention Jia Yun, which stirred something in his heart. Feeling suddenly moved, he retreated gloomily to his room. Lying on his bed, he mulled things over, tossing and turning, feeling utterly listless.
Then he heard a soft voice from outside the window calling, “Hong’er, I found your silk handkerchief here.”
Startled, Xiao Hong hurried out to see—and there stood Jia Yun. Blushing furiously, Xiao Hong asked, “Second Master, where did you find it?”
Jia Yun smiled and said, “Come here; I’ll tell you.” As he spoke, he reached out and tugged at her clothing. Embarrassed, Xiao Hong spun around to run, but she tripped on the doorstep.
